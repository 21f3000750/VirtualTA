Please post any discrepancies related to project1.


@carlton


Who were evaluated? How did we decide what to evaluate?


All the image ids we evaluated were what 
you
 submitted to us. This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by 
@s.anand
 as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos 
you
 gave us.


For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.

Bug fixes


If you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix. So it is in your interest to look through our scripts and logs and identify bugs or anomalies. You might just go from 0 to heros.


Kind regards,

@carlton
 Please make clear what the average marks are, what highest marks are, and how the project will be evaulated.


We are very close to the end semester exam, and we are still not clear on assignment and project marks. It is a bit frustrating to plan in such circumstances.

You have to see the logs for that. We have shared the logs. Everyone was graded by the exact same code, so there is no partiality. Your code did not produce consistent results.

I have noticed that my image was run on a 
x86_64
 architecture ( I can see my email in the logs shared ) whereas I built this docker image on my mac which is 
ARM
. This is why I can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the 
exec format error
.


This was never mentioned on which architecture machine, our images will be evaluated. I request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.

## Post #8 by 22f2001389 (Post ID: 612335)
My evaluation log file is missing, although I followed all the steps to generate the docker image correctly, it’s showing the server didn’t start for 5 minutes but when I uploaded it, it was working fine. Please help me out sir, I worked hard on the project. I’ll get a zero, but I made the submissions correctly. Some other student also got the “server didn’t start in 5 minutes” but he has an evaluation log file. Please kindly help me out. My roll no. is 22f2001389

@carlton
  same issue, My image was also run on a 
x86_64
 architecture. I too built on my mac which is 
ARM
 (M1 Processor). I too can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the 
exec format error
  and  
Evaluation log file
 is MISSING.


Actually my image was run on x86_64 architecture as it was present in that log file and because of the wrong architecture it never started.


I also request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.

### Image Insight:
![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/0/b/0b6f4a9053f0f57c567c507af19f734eb316ca4d_2_690x77.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a dark-themed interface, likely from a container registry or similar software, displaying information about a Docker image. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **TAG:** This section indicates the image tag is "latest," with a green circle next to it suggesting it's the most recent version.  It also notes the image was last pushed about a month ago by a user named "pradeepmondal".

* **Digest:** A long alphanumeric string (`a4d9cad3b5f5`) is displayed, representing a unique identifier for the image's contents.

* **OS/ARCH:** This specifies the operating system and architecture of the image: `linux/arm64/v8` (Linux for 64-bit ARM processors).

* **Last pull:** Indicates the image was last pulled one day ago.

* **Compressed size:** Shows the compressed size of the image is 179.2 MB.

* **Docker pull command:** A text box displays a `docker pull` command ready to copy: `docker pull pradeepmondal/final-tds-project-pradeep-mondal:latest`. This is the command used to download the image. A blue "Copy" button is adjacent to this command.


In short, the image provides a summary of a Docker image named `pradeepmondal/final-tds-project-pradeep-mondal:latest`, including its version, size, last update, and a command to download it.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/4/a/4ab114b0db84001838ccde428fb3ece583a87cd2_2_690x95.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a terminal output, specifically the result of a `podman run` command. Let's break down the content:

**Command:**

The first line displays the command executed:  `podman run --rm -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 047fa151bf43`. This indicates that a container was run using `podman`. Let's dissect the flags:

* `--rm`: This flag automatically removes the container once it exits.
* `-e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN`: This sets an environment variable named `AIPROXY_TOKEN` within the container.  The value is taken from a variable named `AIPROXY_TOKEN` in the host environment. This suggests the container uses some sort of API proxy and requires an authentication token.
* `-p 8000:8000`: This maps port 8000 on the host machine to port 8000 inside the container.  This means that whatever service is running inside the container will be accessible on port 8000 of the host machine.
* `047fa151bf43`: This seems to be a container ID or image ID.


**Output:**

The subsequent lines show the output of the container's startup process:

* `INFO: Started server process [1]`: The application inside the container started a server process.
* `INFO: Waiting for application startup.`: The container is waiting for the application to fully initialize.
* `INFO: Application startup complete.`: The application startup is finished successfully.
* `INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)`: This is the most important line. It indicates that a web server (Uvicorn, a popular ASGI server for Python) is running and accessible via `http://0.0.0.0:8000`. `0.0.0.0` means it listens on all available interfaces.  The message also informs the user how to stop the process (Ctrl+C).


**In summary:**  The image displays a successful `podman` command that starts a container (likely a Python application using Uvicorn) and makes it accessible via `http://0.0.0.0:8000`. The container uses an API proxy requiring authentication, and the container is automatically removed upon termination.  The `047fa151bf43` might be a container or image ID that could be used for further tracking or management.

My evaluation log file is missing.

The 2 other log files i’m given doesnt have my email inside it listed.

the Image id which is given in the MAIL is not present in my docker desktop, my project’s docker image is listed in docker desktop, which doesnot matches the image id given in the MAIL,

What was evaluated? How it was evaluated?


This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: 0ade87d1bf07


My terminal shows 2 images as last, with respective image ids. I am not sure which one is the real, so please check with both the ids.

tds-project-1              latest    c854274f078d   5 weeks ago    1.38GB

I wanted to kindly request if you could review the bonus additional tasks, as they were not reflected in the evaluation, despite being mentioned in the instructions. Apart from that I understand and accept my score overall, especially since I had hardcoded the folder paths in my prompt for some questions, which I believe led to those failures.




Bonus: Additional tasks
. We 
may
 pass additional tasks beyond the list above. If your code handles them correctly, you get 1 bonus mark per task.

**Image Description:** The image shows a code snippet detailing a test that has failed.  Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Lines:** These lines report the HTTP response from a GET request to a local server. The server successfully returned data (HTTP 200 OK) and saved it to a file named `b6.json` in a `/data/` directory.

* **`EXPECTED:` Section:** This section shows the expected output of a test.  It's a list of strings, each representing a name enclosed in single quotes, containing a list of authors.  The names are: Albert Einstein (multiple times), J.K. Rowling, Jane Austen, Marilyn Monroe, André Gide, Thomas A. Edison, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Steve Martin.  Note the slight variation in the spelling of "André Gide" compared to the "RESULT" section.

* **`RESULT:` Section:** This section displays the actual result from the test.  It's a JSON object, with a single key-value pair. The key is ".author" and the value is a list of strings, very similar to the `EXPECTED` list of names. The main difference is the encoding of "André Gide"  (it is shown as  "Andr\u00e9 Gide" in the RESULT, indicating a Unicode encoding).

* **`B6 FAILED`:** This line at the very bottom clearly indicates that the test case labeled "B6" failed.  The discrepancy likely comes from the different representation of "André Gide" in the `EXPECTED` and `RESULT` sections.

In summary, the image depicts a test failure due to a minor encoding difference in the author's name "André Gide" between the expected and actual outputs.  The test was fetching data from a local server and comparing it against a predefined list of author names.

The task was done but the LLM made a mistake. I think this type of mistake was outside our control.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/f/b/fb3792e2a76ea8dd4cead0146f0366ceabc3dbb3_2_690x304.png)

**Image Description:** This image shows a log of a program's execution, likely a test suite, focusing on a task that extracts a credit card number from an image.

Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Section (Test Status):**  The top line indicates a test case "A7" has "PASSED".  This suggests an automated testing framework.

* **Running Task Description:**  A yellow circle highlights the main task:  The program is instructed to process an image (`/data/card.jpg`), extract the credit card number from it using a Large Language Model (LLM), and save the number (without spaces) to a file (`/data/cc-number.txt`).

* **HTTP Requests:** The log shows two HTTP requests:
    * A `POST` request to `http://localhost:8001/run`. This request sends the image path and instructions to the server for processing. The URL encoding is visible in the request.
    * A `GET` request to `http://localhost:8001/read?path=/data/cc-number.txt`.  This retrieves the results (the extracted credit card number) from the file created in the previous step.  Both requests receive a `200 OK` response, indicating success.

* **HTTP 200 Response:** A green circle indicates a successful response (HTTP status code 200) from the server. The JSON response confirms the task's successful completion.

* **Result Verification:** The bottom section shows the expected and actual credit card numbers extracted.  The expected number is `6011598665215965`. The result, however, shows a slightly different number `6011598656215965`, indicating a mismatch. Despite this difference, the test case still passed, meaning the difference is likely acceptable for this context or that the passing condition did not fully check the extracted credit card number.

In short, the image displays the workflow of extracting a credit card number from an image using an LLM and the results, though an important digit is different between the expected and actual values.  The discrepancy might suggest a minor error in the LLM's OCR capability, but the overall test still shows success.

Please correct me if I’m wrong, but I noticed that for tasks 
B7
, 
B8
, and 
B10
, the evaluation log does not include any 
POST
 or 
GET
 request traces
, unlike the other tasks which have clearly recorded request flows, generated code, and outputs. In these three cases, the log shows only the failure message without any indication that the script was executed or that the output file was read.

**Image Description:** The image shows the output of an automated testing process, likely part of a software development or data science pipeline.  The core content consists of text, primarily representing HTTP requests and responses, along with the results of several tasks.

**Key sections and details:**

1. **HTTP POST Request:** This section details a POST request sent to `http://localhost:8278/zun`. The request's purpose is to extract and save all authors from a website (`quotes.toscrape.com`) into a JSON file (`/data/b6.json`).  The request includes a task description explaining the process and expected output format.  The response indicates success (`HTTP/1.1 200 OK`) and shows the Python code used to achieve this task.  The code uses libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping and JSON handling.

2. **HTTP GET Request:** A subsequent GET request is shown, retrieving the data from the `/data/b6.json` file. This request also succeeded (`B6 PASSED`).

3. **Running Task & Results:** This part describes a task to download, resize, and save an image.  The image URL is `https://dummyimage.com/100x100/ad0434/ad0434.png`.  The task was supposed to resize the image to 50x50 pixels and save it to `/data/b7.png`, but it shows up as "failed" multiple times. Task B8 shows a failure due to string formatting issues.

4. **Success/Failure Indicators:** Green checkmarks indicate successful tasks (B6), while red crosses and circles indicate failures (B7 and B8). This provides a clear visual overview of the test results.

In summary, the image displays a log of automated tasks, primarily focused on web scraping and image processing.  The failures highlight potential bugs or issues in the implementation of the image manipulation task and string formatting. The Python code provides insight into the logic behind the scraping task.

**Image Description:** The image shows a mobile phone screen displaying the results of a docker image evaluation. 


The text details the evaluation process and its outcome.  Crucially, the evaluation failed due to missing files. The text indicates the following:

* **Evaluation Failure:** The docker image evaluation did not complete successfully due to either a failure to run or misconfiguration.
* **Missing Files:**  Several critical files are missing, resulting in a score of 0. These files include evaluation logs, docker logs, server start logs, evaluation scripts, a data generation file, a docker orchestration file, and a solution script.  The report specifies the location of one file (the Docker log file) with a Google Drive link. Other files are listed as "See attachment".
* **System Specifications:** The evaluation ran on an 8-core Xeon Google Cloud compute unit with 1 Gigabit of dedicated network bandwidth.
* **File Descriptions:** Each missing file is briefly described in numbered points (1-7) explaining its purpose in the evaluation process.
* **Docker Image ID:** The ID of the evaluated docker image is provided: `e1f186d9ce91`.
* **Contact Information:** Instructions are given on how to contact the evaluators if there is a discrepancy.

In short, the image provides the results of a failed docker image evaluation, explaining the reasons for failure and providing details about the missing files and the evaluation's environment. The use of numbered points makes it easy to identify each missing element and their function.

The contents of Expected and Result matches, but still test case’s failed.

Is there formatting check for answer , Isn’t prettier to be done ?

I see that your expected answer isn’t formatted using prettier , am i wrong ?


eg:


 EXPECTED:

[{‘first_name’: ‘Kevin’, ‘last_name’: ‘Allen’, ‘email’: ‘tonya41@example.com’}, {‘first_name’: ‘Kimberly’, ‘last_name’: ‘Allison’, ‘email’: ‘vmendoza@example.com’}, {‘first_name’: ‘Kathleen’, ‘last_name’: ‘Baldwin’, ‘email’: ‘amclean@example.com’}, {‘first_name’: ‘Jason’, ‘last_name’: ‘Banks’, ‘email’: ‘sharptara@example.org’}, {‘first_name’: ‘Tami’, ‘last_name’: ‘Bass’, ‘email’: ‘kristy61@example.com’}, {‘first_name’: ‘Brenda’, …


 RESULT:

[

Hi

We will identify why arm images created a problem and were run using x86 platform.


We will also rerun evaluations for all the x86 and arm images one more time, before pushing to the dashboard.

My evaluation log file is missing in report provided. It says tasksA was not found. but I have submitted tasksA in my project file. Also it says server didnt start for 5 mins but for me image was working fine. please kindly help me out. I have made submissions correctly.






It would have run at your end but it was supposed to run at anywhere, after dockerising it didn’t run, reason is taskA module was not found.

**Image Description:** This image shows the result of a test, likely an automated test of a web application or script.  The test appears to involve scraping data and saving it to a JSON file.  Let's break down the key parts:

* **HTTP 200 "Scraped data saved to ./data/b6.json":** This line indicates that a successful HTTP request (status code 200) resulted in scraping data which was then saved to a file named `b6.json` in the `/data` directory.

* **HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8052/read?path=/data/b6.json "HTTP/1.1 200 OK":** This details the HTTP GET request made to retrieve the data.  The URL points to a local server (`localhost:8052`) with a path parameter specifying the file to read (`/data/b6.json`). The server responded with a 200 OK status code.

* **`/data/b6.json`:** This is the path to the JSON file containing the scraped data.  The path is highlighted in red, suggesting it may be relevant to the test's failure.

* **▲ EXPECTED:** This section shows the expected outcome of the data scraping.  It lists a set of names (famous people)  enclosed in an array. The array contains slight inconsistencies in its formatting (some names are enclosed in double quotes while some are in single quotes).

* **▲ RESULT:** This section shows the actual result obtained.  It's a JSON object with a single key-value pair. The key is `.author`, and the value is an array containing the same list of names as the `EXPECTED` section.  However, the character encoding for "André Gide" appears to be different in the `RESULT` section. The inconsistency and encoding difference may be the reason for the test failure.

* **X B6 FAILED:**  This clearly indicates the test case (likely named "B6") failed. The difference between the `EXPECTED` and `RESULT` sections, specifically the character encoding issue in André Gide's name, most likely caused the failure.

In summary, the image displays the logs of a test case that failed because of a minor discrepancy between the expected and actual data (a difference in character encoding of a name), highlighting the importance of meticulous data handling in automated testing.

**Image Description:** The image shows a log of HTTP requests and the results of several tasks.  Here's a breakdown:

**HTTP Requests:**

* **POST Request:** This request sends data to the endpoint `/zun` on `localhost:8278`. The task description indicates it's scraping author names from `quotes.toscrape.com` and saving them to a JSON file (`/data/b6.json`). The response is `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`, indicating success. The generated Python code snippet within the response demonstrates the scraping process.

* **GET Request:**  This request retrieves the JSON file created in the previous step (`/data/b6.json`) from `localhost:8278/read`.  It also returned a `200 OK` status code.

**Task Results:**

The log shows the results of subsequent tasks:

* **B6 (PASSED):** This task successfully completed the POST request and likely the creation and population of `/data/b6.json`.

* **B7 (FAILED):** This task attempted to download, resize, and save an image from `https://dummyimage.com/100x100/ad0434/ad0434.png`. It failed multiple times, as indicated by the repeated "X B7 FAILED" entries.

* **B8 (FAILED):** This task failed due to a string formatting error ("not all arguments converted during string formatting").  This suggests a problem with how data was handled in the task.

**In Summary:**

The image documents the execution of a web scraping task and an image processing task.  The scraping part succeeded, but the image processing failed due to at least two separate issues.  The detailed error messages for B7 and B8 would be needed to diagnose the cause of their failures more precisely.

It was a good project, and I have obtained the log files. Upon reviewing the log files, I realized that they are unable to read the files. I checked my project on GitHub and discovered that I forgot to uncomment the line that defines the path using the 
os
 library. As a result, all file evaluations returned errors such as “can’t read the file.”


I understand that this oversight was my mistake. However, is there any way to reevaluate the code by simply uncommenting that line? I believe the rest of the code is properly written, but due to this single comment, all the files remained unchecked or resulted in errors.

**Image Description:** The image shows a Google Chrome browser window displaying a text file, likely a log file from an evaluation process.  The file details several HTTP requests and their outcomes, highlighting issues and successes.

**Key Features & Content:**

* **File Name:** The file's name is partially visible in the browser's address bar and shows `24f1002555@ds.study.iitm.ac.in_evaluation.log`.  This suggests an evaluation log for a user with that email address, likely related to a study at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.

* **HTTP Requests and Responses:** The log is primarily comprised of entries showing HTTP requests (GET and POST) made to various URLs, including `localhost:8138/read?path=...`,  `localhost:8138/rum?task=...`, and `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`. The responses indicate the status code (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error, 200 OK).  The paths involved suggest the system is attempting to read files from a `/data/` directory.

* **Task Descriptions:** The log contains descriptions of tasks being performed, such as:
    * Reading files (`/data/mail-sender.txt`, `/data/cc-number.txt`).
    * Processing an image (`/data/card.jpg`) to extract a credit card number.
    * Finding the most similar pair of comments from a file (`/data/comments.txt`).

* **Error Indications:**  Red dots and "FAILED" markers next to certain entries indicate failures. These failures are primarily due to the system being unable to find or read files (404 and 500 errors).

* **LLM Integration:** The presence of the `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings` URL and the mention of "LLM" (Large Language Model) strongly suggests the use of an LLM for tasks involving image processing and text analysis.

* **Bottom of Image:** The bottom of the image shows a system tray with various application icons and some system information (temperature, time, and date).


In summary, the image shows a debugging log tracing several automated tasks, primarily file processing and LLM-based operations, and highlighting various errors encountered during the evaluation. The errors appear to stem from issues with accessing files within the `/data/` directory, suggesting a file path, permission, or file existence problem.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/0/7/078748473287587894e2c880e392cb511618d1f2_2_690x388.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a code editor, specifically VS Code, displaying a Python file named `app.py`.  The file appears to be part of a larger project, "LLM-based-Automation-Agent," hosted on GitHub.

**Code:** The central part of the image shows Python code.  The code defines several asynchronous functions:

* `start()`: Returns a welcome message.
* `read_file(path: str)`: Reads a file from a specified path. It includes error handling for missing paths or files not being in the designated data folder.  It returns the file's content or an error message.
* `run_task(task: str)`: This function is only partially visible but appears to handle a task based on a string input.

The code uses error handling (`try...except`) and raises `HTTPException` for various errors (file path required, file not found, internal server error).  The `is_path_in_data_folder` function is called to validate file paths.


**File Explorer:** On the left, a file explorer shows the project's structure.  Key files include `app.py` (the currently viewed file), `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, and `README.md`. This suggests a Python project with build instructions (Dockerfile), project metadata (package.json, pyproject.toml), and standard documentation.

**Symbols Panel:** On the right, a "Symbols" panel lists the functions and constants defined in `app.py`. This includes `ai_proxy_url`, `ai_proxy_embeddings_url`, `ai_proxy_api`, and several functions relating to tasks, file operations, and data manipulation.

**Top Bar:** The top bar displays the browser (likely Chrome) showing the GitHub repository URL:  `github.com/Pritul-Raut/LLM-based-Automation-Agent/blob/main/app.py`.  This confirms the code's source and version.

**Bottom Bar:** The Windows taskbar is visible at the bottom, showing various applications and the time and date (08:41 AM, 29-03-2025).

In summary, the image depicts a developer working on a Python application that likely interfaces with an LLM (Large Language Model) based on the project name and the presence of functions like `run_task`.  The code appears designed to handle file I/O and interacts with an external service or API (indicated by the `ai_proxy`-related constants).

I noticed that my Docker image was run on an x86_64 architecture (as indicated by my email in the shared logs), whereas I originally built it on my Mac (ARM architecture). Due to this mismatch, the image failed to run properly and resulted in an exec format error.


Since there was no prior mention of the architecture on which our images would be evaluated, I request that my evaluation be conducted again on the appropriate machine. Please help as after doing it correctly getting 0 marks because of such an error feels wrong

## Post #41 by carlton (Post ID: 612408)
@23f2001975
 we had to rely on docker telling us whether an image was arm or x86. So thats why we just did what docker software told us. If it classified an image as arm then we ran it on arm. If it did not then we ran it on x86. Thats why we need students to look through the logs and identify issues so that we can make sure you get the correct evaluation.


If students notify us their image is actually arm based, then we will run it on arm. So dont worry, just inform us of any discrepancy as well as bugs. Our evaluation might not be perfect, there may be bugs. If students can precisely create bug reports then we can take that into consideration when evaluating students as well. The benefit being you might get extra marks because of the bug fix.


We have a script that looks at this discourse post each day and tells us who requires a fresh evaluation. So we will check your image on arm.


Kind regards

**Image Description:** The image contains a Python traceback, indicating a runtime error.  Let's break down the key parts:

* **`Traceback (most recent call last):`**: This line indicates the start of the error traceback, showing the sequence of function calls leading to the error.

* **`File "/app/app.py", line 30, in <module>`**: This shows the error occurred in the file `/app/app.py` on line 30, within the main module ( `<module>` indicates the top-level code of the file).

* **`AIPROXY_TOKEN = os.environ['AIRPROXY_TOKEN']`**: This line of code attempts to retrieve an environment variable named `'AIRPROXY_TOKEN'` and assign it to the variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN`.  The `os.environ` dictionary contains system environment variables.  The tilde characters (`~`) seem to be added for emphasis in this section possibly indicating where the error is pointing. The space in `AIRPROXY TOKEN` may be a cause of the error if this variable is not defined with the space

* **`File "<frozen os>", line 716, in _getitem_`**:  This indicates the error originated within the `os` module's internal `_getitem_` method (likely used for accessing items in a dictionary). This line demonstrates that the error occurred while trying to access the specified item within the `os.environ` dictionary.

* **`KeyError: 'AIRPROXY_TOKEN'`**: This is the actual error message. A `KeyError` means the program tried to access a key ('AIRPROXY_TOKEN' in this case) that doesn't exist in the `os.environ` dictionary – the environment variable `AIRPROXY_TOKEN` hasn't been set.

**In summary:** The Python script failed because the environment variable `AIRPROXY_TOKEN` is not defined on the system where the script is running. The script needs this variable, likely containing an authentication token or similar information, to function correctly.  The most likely solution is to define this environment variable before running the script.

**Image Description:** This image shows a Python traceback error.  Let's break down the relevant parts:

* **`Traceback (most recent call last):`**: This indicates the start of an error report, showing the sequence of function calls that led to the error.

* **`File "/app/app.py", line 30, in <module>`**: This line pinpoints the source of the error.  The error occurred in the file `/app/app.py` on line 30, within the main part of the script (`<module>`).

* **`AIPROXY_TOKEN = os.environ['AIRPROXY_TOKEN']`**: This is the line of code causing the problem.  It attempts to retrieve the value associated with the environment variable `'AIRPROXY_TOKEN'` using `os.environ`. The key error is that the variable is not found.  Note the potential typo: `['AIRPROXY_TOKEN']` should probably be `['AIRPROXY_TOKEN']`. 

* **`File "<frozen os>", line 716, in _getitem_`**: This shows that the error originated within the internal `_getitem_` method of the `os` module (which handles dictionary-like access to environment variables).

* **`KeyError: 'AIRPROXY_TOKEN'`**: This is the actual error message. A `KeyError` happens when you try to access a dictionary key that doesn't exist. In this case, the environment variable `AIRPROXY_TOKEN` is missing.


In short, the error means the Python script is trying to read an environment variable named `AIRPROXY_TOKEN`, but that variable isn't set in the system's environment.  The likely solution is to set the `AIRPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable before running the script, or to check if it exists before trying to use it.  The slight variation in capitalization ('AIRPROXY_TOKEN' vs. 'AIRPROXY TOKEN') is also something to look into as it might further contribute to the problem.

We demoed in the live session the complete process of how to dockerise your project so that it can be run anywhere. Running on your local machine is not a sufficient criteria for passing the evaluation. It is absolutely vital for students to understand deployment. This is a critical skill for anyone who is serious about working in this field.


Also just check if yours is an arm based image or x86. Sometimes that makes a difference. For us there is no way to know other than docker software telling us. As it turns out several students had an arm based image but docker did not tell us that. So we will re run those.


If yours has been run on the wrong emulation then we will re run.


Kind regards

I encountered an HTTP 500 error with the following detail:


{
"detail": "'choices'"
}



This issue appears across all tasks, even though they were running fine before submission. I suspect there might be a problem with APIPROXY_TOKEN. Could you please look into this?


Additionally, my solution is very similar to the one shared by the System Commands team in their email.

**Image Description:** The image shows a log of a process, likely an automated script execution, that is failing repeatedly.  The log is organized into sections, each pertaining to a task and its results.  Each task section contains the following:

* **A colored circle and label:**  Yellow circles indicate a task beginning ("Running task:"), red circles indicate failures ("HTTP 500", "Al failed"), and red 'X' marks denote overall task failures ("A1 FAILED", "A2 FAILED").

* **Task Description:** This describes the operation being performed. For example, "Install `uv` (if required) and run the script...",  or "Format `/data/format.md` with `prettier@3.4.2` in-place".

* **HTTP Request:** This shows the HTTP request sent to a server (likely `localhost:8180`) to execute the task.  The request includes the task name and parameters, encoded in a URL.

* **HTTP Response:** The server's response, including the status code (e.g., "HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error", "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"). If there's an error, there might be a JSON response giving more details as seen with `"detail": ""choices'"`


**Key Problems:**

The log consistently shows HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error) responses, indicating problems with the server-side processing.  Further compounding this is that the GET requests (`/read?path=/data/format.md`) to retrieve the `/data/format.md` file all return 404 (Not Found) errors, indicating the file is not accessible at the specified path, or the server cannot locate it.


**To diagnose this:**

1. **Server-Side Issues:** The HTTP 500 errors point to problems with the application running on `localhost:8180`. The server code needs investigation.

2. **File Path:** The 404 errors for `/data/format.md` suggest that either the file doesn't exist in the expected location on the server or the server isn't configured to serve files from that directory. Verify the existence and permissions of this file.

3. **Script Errors:** Though not directly shown, the underlying python script (`datagen.py`) might have internal errors that trigger the server errors.  Checking the script's logs would be necessary.

**Image Description:** The image contains a text file, `/data/logs-latest.txt`, showing the results of a test.  The top section, marked "EXPECTED:", shows the expected output of a program or process.  The bottom section, marked "RESULT:", shows the actual output.  A final line, "A5 FAILED", indicates that the test case A5 failed because the expected and actual outputs do not match.

Both the "EXPECTED" and "RESULT" sections contain the same sequence of sentences, but there are slight differences in punctuation and spacing (e.g., periods and spacing around some words).  This difference explains the test failure.  The text itself appears to be a sequence of short, cryptic sentences, possibly representing a code or a test case.  There are no clear keywords that suggest the specific nature of the code or test. The lack of consistent formatting, mixed capitalization, and general lack of structure suggest a simple text-based test, possibly for a natural language processing task.

**Image Description:** This image shows a long segment of text output from a Python application's log file.  The log details a series of events culminating in a 500 Internal Server Error.  Let's break down the key parts:

**1. Application Startup and Task Execution:** The log begins showing successful server startup and initialization.  A task named "Say Hello Carlton" is initiated, calling a function `extract_specific_text_using_llm`.

**2. Function Call Details:**  There's a detailed JSON-like structure showing arguments passed to the `extract_specific_text_using_llm` function. These include input and output file paths ("system_input.txt" and "output.txt" respectively) and the task description.  The log also shows OpenAI API call details (likely used for large language model processing), including token counts, costs, and the model used (`gpt-40-mini-2024-07-18`).

**3. Error and Traceback:** The core issue is a `FileNotFoundError`. The application tries to open "system_input.txt" using `with open(...)`, but the file doesn't exist, resulting in the error. This triggers nested exception handling, producing multiple traceback messages showing where the error occurred within the application's code (`/app/main.py` and `/app/function_tasks.py`).  The error propagates up, ultimately resulting in a HTTP 500 error returned to the client.

**Key Information for Troubleshooting:**

* **`FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: "system_input.txt"`:** This is the root cause. The file "system_input.txt" is missing from the expected location.
* **File Paths:** The error messages clearly indicate the files involved (`/app/main.py`, `/app/function_tasks.py`, "system_input.txt", "output.txt").  Knowing the application's directory structure is crucial for debugging.
* **Line Numbers:** The traceback provides specific line numbers in the source code where the error originated. This is invaluable for finding and fixing the bug.
* **HTTP 500 Error:** The 500 error signifies a server-side problem, correctly reflecting the underlying file not found issue.
* **OpenAI API Call Details:** The inclusion of OpenAI API details suggests the application uses a large language model for text processing.  Examining this information might help determine if the model's input is dependent on the missing file.


In summary, the image provides a comprehensive log of the application's failure, pointing directly to a missing input file as the primary source of the 500 Internal Server Error.  The detailed tracebacks allow for precise identification of the code segments requiring attention.

Hi 
@carlton
 !


I am reaching out with deep frustration and concern regarding the evaluation of my project. I have worked tirelessly on this for almost two weeks, dedicating day and night to ensure that the tasks were executed correctly. During my own testing, I was able to get at least 7 out of 10 A tasks working as expected. However, after the evaluation, I was informed that none of the tasks were executed properly, which was quite shocking!


Given the effort and time I have put in, I kindly request you to review my project once more. I am more than willing to demonstrate the functionality in real time to clarify any issues or misunderstandings.

Hi 
@22f2001389


  File "/app/app.py", line 4, in <module>
    from tasksA import *
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tasksA'



The error occurs because Python cannot find the 
tasksA
 module. This is due to the file not existing, not being in the correct directory.


Kind regards

what is the reason for this?

It was running properly before, please help.






Try running docker container after pulling, check if evaluate.py is able to do it’s job.

**Image Description:** This image shows a terminal session, likely on a Linux system, displaying commands and their outputs related to Docker.  Let's break down the content:

**1. Docker Image Pull:**

The first section shows the output of a `docker pull` command.  The key details are:

* **Image:** `rohit23f1001156/project1_tds:v3`  This is the name of the Docker image being pulled, specifying a user (`rohit23f1001156`), a repository (`project1_tds`), and a tag (`v3`).  The tag indicates a specific version of the image.
* **Platform:** `--platform arm64` indicates that the image is being pulled for an ARM64 architecture (common in mobile devices and some servers).
* **Digest:** A SHA256 hash (`sha256:bd2d0e570ec6b9a4a2b1565602a7c6abd118c4df06ca39e9dd78b0c06cab7542`) is provided, verifying the image's integrity.
* **Status:**  "Downloaded newer image" confirms a successful pull and that the local version was outdated.

**2. Docker Image Listing:**

The second section uses `docker images | grep "rohit23f1001156/project1_tds"`.  This command lists all Docker images and then filters the output to only show those matching the specified image name.  The output reveals:

* **Image:** `rohit23f1001156/project1_tds` (same as above)
* **Tag:** `v3` (same as above)
* **Image ID:** `468630ef32b8`  A unique identifier for this specific image.
* **Created:** "5 weeks ago" showing when this image was built.
* **Size:** `581MB` the size of the image.


**3. User and Directory:**

The lines starting with `usr_22f3002542_ds_study_iitm_ac_@tds-course-temp-bq:` indicate the user's username and the current directory.  This suggests a potentially virtualized or cloud-based environment. The `~` at the end of the last line indicates that the user's prompt is in the home directory.


In summary, the image demonstrates the process of pulling and verifying a specific Docker image for an ARM64 architecture.  The user is working within a particular project (`project1_tds`) and is managing a Docker environment.

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a computer screen displaying a file explorer window, likely within a code editor or IDE.  The window shows a directory listing with a variety of files and folders.

**Key Features and Text:**

* **File Listing:** The main focus is a list of files and folders, many of which suggest a Python project.  Files include:
    * `pip.exe`, `pip3.13.exe`, `pip3.exe`, `python.exe`, `pythonw.exe`:  Various Python executables.
    * `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore`: Configuration files for Git version control and Docker containerization, respectively.
    * `pyvenv.cfg`: Configuration for a Python virtual environment.
    * `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`: Python script files, suggesting different parts of the application.
    * `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`: Files for defining and building Docker containers.
    * `requirements.txt`: A file listing project dependencies.
    * `.env`:  Likely an environment file for configuration variables.

* **Line Numbers:** Line numbers (17-22) are visible to the right of the top section of files.

* **File Icons:** Small icons to the left of the filenames indicate file types (e.g., scripts, configuration files).

* **Bottom Bar:** The bottom bar shows:
    * `OUTLINE`, `TIMELINE`: Likely navigation options within the IDE.
    * A message: "Python extension loading..." indicating ongoing activity.
    * A search bar: "Type here to search".

* **File Path (Partial):** A partial path is visible in the lower-right corner: `C:\Users\Ri...` indicating the location of the project on a Windows system.  Another partial path is shown in the command prompt: `C:\Users\...`

* **Command Prompt (Partial):** A partial command prompt window is visible in the lower right with `(tds_roe) C:\`  and `History` suggesting a Git Bash or similar terminal.

**In summary:** The image depicts a developer's workspace showing a Python project organized using tools like Git and Docker. The "Python extension loading" message suggests the IDE or editor is loading its Python support components. The partial file paths and command prompt hint at the project's location and potentially ongoing operations.

Yeah, it’s there on your local machine, but you didn’t copy it to docker container.

Below is content of your docker file which doesn’t copy tasksA.py file it only copies app.py. You could have figured this out by just running docker container on your local machine earlier, it would have shown you that error.


FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates

# Download and install uv
ADD https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh /uv-installer.sh
RUN sh /uv-installer.sh && rm /uv-installer.sh

# Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
RUN pip install fastapi uvicorn

# Ensure the installed binary is on the `PATH`
ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Set up the application directory

# Copy application files
COPY app.py /app

# Explicitly set the correct binary path and use `sh -c`

 good afternoon sir,

I completed my project 1 and submitted it as instructed. But the result show that evaluate file missing. I did everything right but don’t know how this as the result come. I also had evaluation file in my project too. Please go through things again as this is very unfair for those who took 2 weeks to do this project. My roll no. is 22f3001664.

**Image Description:** Here's a description of the image:

The image is a meme using a picture of a large stadium under construction.  The stadium is mostly complete, showing a large, circular seating area, a green playing field, and supporting structures. However, a significant portion of seating in the stands is still under construction, visibly supported by scaffolding and featuring bright red, unfinished seating elements. This unfinished section is angled, adding to the precarious visual effect. 


Overlaid on the image is text in a bold, sans-serif font. The text reads:

* **WHEN YOU CANNOT REFACTOR THE CODE** (at the top)
* **BECAUSE OF A TIGHT DEADLINE** (at the bottom)

The meme uses the visual analogy of the incomplete stadium to represent a software project that, due to a tight deadline, is launched or shipped with unfinished or poorly designed elements (represented by the uncompleted and seemingly precariously attached seating). The unfinished state of the code is paralleled by the incomplete stadium.  A small website address, "imgflip.com," is visible in the bottom-left corner.

We looked at your script and there are errors in it. It doesn’t follow what we mentioned in live sessions.


Line number 81 of your app.py


subprocess.run(["uv", "run", script_name, "--root", "./data"] + args, check=True)


which creates a data directory inside app directory but evaluate.py expects data directory to be in root directory.

@Jivraj
 
@carlton


I’m writing here to express my concerns regarding the evaluation of my TDS Project-1. Also, kindly pardon me for the long message.


I have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday.


These are the detailed point wise concerns :






I at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it’s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2½ weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course.






By this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn’t receive a reply.






I understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them.






I also didn’t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link.






I have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn’t process it) is very unfair.


Kindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written, whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the project with little knowledge.


I hope you would look into my plight, and take necessary measures.


Thanks and Regards

**Image Description:** This image shows a screenshot of a file management interface, likely from a version control system like Git.  The top shows the path `TDS_Project_1/App/`, indicating the current directory.  The user's name, `RaunakNarwal735`, is displayed alongside a recent commit message: "Update Dockerfile".  The commit hash (`c07b746`) and date ("last month") are also shown.  A "History" button suggests access to a commit history.

The main part of the screenshot is a table listing files and directories within the `/App/` directory:

* **Name:** This column lists the names of files and directories.  These include:
    * `...`:  Represents a parent directory.
    * `.env`:  Likely an environment file containing configuration settings.
    * `Dockerfile`: A file defining the structure of a Docker container.
    * `app.py`:  Suggests the main application file written in Python.
    * `readme.md`:  A Markdown file containing information about the project.
    * `tasksA.py` and `tasksB.py`: Python files likely containing tasks or functions.

* **Last commit message:** This column details the action that was performed on the files in the last commit. This includes actions such as "Add files via upload" and "Update Dockerfile".

* **Last commit date:** This column indicates when each file was last modified in a committed change – all shown as "last month".

The presence of a `Dockerfile` and Python files (`app.py`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`) indicates that this project is likely a Python application containerized using Docker.  The `.env` file suggests environment-specific configurations.  The `readme.md` file provides typical documentation.  The overall structure is consistent with a typical software project layout.

**Image Description:** This image shows a snippet of what appears to be information from a software package registry or container repository.  Here's a breakdown:

* **TAG:** This label indicates a tag associated with a specific version of the software.  The value "latest" suggests this is the most recent version.

* **Last pushed about 1 month by 23f2000599:** This line indicates when the software was last updated (approximately one month prior) and the user or system ("23f2000599") who performed the update.

* **Digest:** This field shows a cryptographic hash (5217284cc507) of the software's contents. This hash is used to verify the integrity of the software, ensuring that it hasn't been tampered with.

* **OS/ARCH:** This shows the operating system and architecture the software is built for: `linux/amd64`.  This means it's for a 64-bit Linux system.

In summary, the image provides metadata about a software package that was last updated roughly a month ago by user/system "23f2000599," is tagged as "latest", has a specific digest (5217284cc507), and is compatible with 64-bit Linux systems.

## Post #94 by Jivraj (Post ID: 612599)
That’s external port mapping, we mapped your docker’s port 8000 to external 8219 port, so it won’t create issues.


Just look at docker_orchestration.py file for logic behind it, basically it was for evaluating multiple images parallely.

**Image Description:** This image shows a screen capture of a Docker repository page, likely from a container registry.  The repository is named `pscodes24/dataworks-agent`. Key information includes:

* **Repository Details:** The repository was last pushed about a month ago and has a total size of 490.1 MB.  There are options to add a description and a category.

* **Navigation:**  Tabs at the top allow navigation to General settings, Tags, Image Management (currently selected), Collaborators, Webhooks, and Settings.

* **Image Management:** This section displays a table listing images within the repository.  Each row contains:
    * **Digest:**  A SHA256 hash uniquely identifying each image (e.g., `sha256:6e6057d5a26`, `sha256:c9b258fe4894`).  One digest is marked as `latest`.
    * **Tags:**  Currently empty for both images, implying they might only be accessed by digest.
    * **Media Type:** Shows "Image" for both entries indicating Docker images.
    * **OS/ARCH:** Shows `linux/amd64` for both indicating they are built for 64-bit Linux.
    * **Size:** Shows the size of each image (e.g., 273.5 MB, 262.3 MB).
    * **Last Pushed:** Indicates when each image was last pushed.
    * **Last Pulled:**  Shows when each image was last pulled.

* **Search and Filtering:** A search bar allows searching by tag or digest. A dropdown menu allows for filtering the displayed results.

* **Docker Commands:** A section provides a command to push a new tag to the repository.  This is a helpful snippet for users. A "Public view" button is present.

* **Pagination:** A pager at the bottom indicates there are two pages of results, currently viewing page 1 of 2.


The overall context suggests this is a dashboard for managing a Docker image repository.  The information provided is essential for tracking and managing container images, understanding their versions, sizes, and usage history.

**Image Description:** This image shows a test result from what appears to be a software testing framework.  Let's break down the content:

**Top Section:**

* `/data/format.md`: This line likely indicates the file path to a Markdown file containing the expected formatting.
* `▲ EXPECTED:`: This denotes the expected output or behavior of the test.
* `# Header`:  This is a Markdown header, indicating a section title.
* The table below shows the expected structure with columns "Start", "Mid", and "End", each containing a number (1, 2, and 3 respectively).  The `|:-` and `|--:` indicate column alignment in Markdown.
* `Paragraph has extra spaces and trailing whitespace.` This describes the content of the paragraph that's being tested.  It suggests the test is checking for proper handling of extra spaces or whitespace.
* The ````py` section shows a Python snippet: `print("23f3001745@ds.study.iitm.ac.in")` This prints an email address.


**Bottom Section:**

* `▲ RESULT:`: Shows the actual result produced by the code being tested.
* The long string following this shows the actual output.  Note that it contains newline characters (`\n`).  This output matches the expected structure but contains extra whitespace as noted in the `RESULT`.
* `X A2 FAILED`: This clearly indicates that the test (test case A2) failed. The reason for the failure is because the actual result includes extra newlines and whitespace compared to the intended result.

**In summary:**  The test case was designed to check if the software correctly handles extra whitespace in a paragraph within a markdown file and in the code.  The test failed because the software didn't remove or properly format the extra whitespace.

I realized that I made a mistake in my project by forgetting to uncomment a single line of code: os.path.join(os.getcwd(), “path_given”). I feel really bad about this oversight, especially after working so hard on the project and formatting everything carefully. It was an honest mistake, and I take full responsibility for it.


I sincerely request you to consider re-evaluating my work, as I believe it reflects the effort and dedication I put into it. I truly regret this error and will be more careful in the Project 2

**Image Description:** This image shows a Python traceback error.  The most important information is at the very bottom:

* **`KeyError: 'USER_EMAIL'`**: This is the root cause of the error. The program is trying to access an environment variable named `USER_EMAIL`, but this variable is not set.

The traceback itself provides a detailed path showing the sequence of function calls that led to this error.  It starts with the execution of the `uvicorn` command (`/usr/local/bin/uvicorn`) and follows the chain through various modules like `click`, `uvicorn` itself, `asyncio`, and finally to the `os.environ["USER_EMAIL"]` line in a file named `main.py` within the `/app` directory.  Each line indicates the file, line number, and function where the error occurred.

The lines referencing `<frozen importlib._bootstrap>` are common in Python tracebacks and generally indicate the process of importing modules.  They're not directly the cause of the error in this case.

In short, the problem is a missing or incorrectly named environment variable `USER_EMAIL`.  To fix this, the `USER_EMAIL` environment variable needs to be set before running the application.  The exact method of setting this variable depends on the operating system and the environment where the application is run (e.g., using `export USER_EMAIL="your_email@example.com"` in bash).

Hello,


My log file shows a “file not found” or “directory not found” error. Could you confirm whether 
datagen.py
 was executed inside the Docker container or on the host OS? If it ran on the host, I don’t see any mounting process for the

**Image Description:** This image shows a long text output, predominantly a log of server activity and error messages.  The top lines indicate that the application is running in debug mode on a development server, warning against using it for production.  It then lists the addresses it's running on (0.0.0.0, 127.0.0.1:8000, and 172.17.0.8:8000). Instructions to quit using CTRL+C are also present.

The majority of the text is a series of log entries, each showing a timestamp, the IP address of the requestor (mostly 72.17.0.1), the HTTP method (POST or GET), the request URL (often involving `/run?task=` followed by some instructions), the HTTP version, and the response code (typically 500 - Internal Server Error or 404 - Not Found).  The requests appear to involve various tasks, including running scripts, formatting data files, and counting occurrences of Thursdays in a date list.

Crucially, following each failed request (indicated by 500 error codes), there's a traceback, detailing the sequence of function calls that led to the error. These tracebacks point to specific lines within files within the `/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask/app.py` and `/usr/src/app/app.py`.  These error messages almost universally point to an `AttributeError`,  specifically that a `NoneType` object lacks a `lower` attribute.

A key detail is that each traceback shows the line number within the relevant files. This information is vital in debugging the underlying application code.  The log demonstrates a pattern of repeated errors, possibly indicating a bug within the application's processing of the various requests.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/9/4/941a71108a292d453f81c1bd42681cdc91acb222.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a log output, likely from a command-line interface or a debugging tool.  The text indicates a series of events related to data processing and API calls.

Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **`"error": "unable to open database file"`:** This line suggests an initial error encountered while trying to access a database file.  The specific database file isn't named.  The curly brace `}` suggests this might be a snippet of JSON error output.

* **`HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/b10.csv "HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND"`:** This shows an HTTP GET request to a local server (localhost:8000) attempting to retrieve a CSV file named `b10.csv` located in a `/data/` directory. The response was a `404 NOT FOUND` error, meaning the file wasn't found at that location.

* **`B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv` and `X B10 FAILED`:** These lines reiterate the failure to read the `b10.csv` file, possibly from a different process or stage of the execution. The 'X' likely indicates a more critical or fatal failure.  The "B10" might be an identifier for a specific task, data block, or batch.

* **`Score: 12 / 20`:** This indicates a score of 12 out of 20, suggesting a partial success or a metric related to the process's performance.  The context of what is being scored is unclear without more information.

* **`HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"`:**  This line shows a successful HTTP POST request to a different server (`aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev`). It appears to be sending data to an OpenAI embeddings endpoint, likely for processing of some kind.  The `200 OK` response means the request completed successfully.

In summary, the log reveals a problem accessing the `b10.csv` file locally (HTTP 404 error), which caused a failure in a process labeled "B10". Despite this, a subsequent API call to OpenAI for embeddings was successful. The 'Score: 12/20' suggests a metric related to the overall process, possibly dependent on the successfully processed embeddings data.

My docker logs shows that 
OSError: Cannot find resource
 error occurred when the data generation script tried to access font files in generation for a8.


image
1485×807 37.4 KB


The datagen.py script looked for Arial font in the try block and when it encountered error it went to the except block to use DejaVuSans, the Pillow default, except it encountered the same error there, which was not handled. Thus, datagen.py stopped abruptly without creating files for A9 and A10 as well. So effectively, my A9 and A10 did not get evaluated properly as it did not have the required files due to error during data generation for A8. Can you please re-evaluate by enclosing each of the data generation function calls in their own try-except blocks?


image
302×252 3.45 KB

I think it would be better to enclose each of these function calls in their own try-except blocks. This screenshot is taken from the datagen.py file sent in yesterday’s results mail.


So, will it be possible to re-evaluate my task A1, A8, A9 and A10? At least A9 and A10 did not even get the files to work on as they weren’t even created due to insufficient error handling in datagen.py .


Also, can you help me to identify the cause of even the Pillow default font not being available? I don’t understand how a font not being available could be caused by my code.


Thank you

**Image Description:** This image shows a terminal output displaying Python error messages.  The core issue is an `OSError: cannot open resource`.  This error occurs twice, within different code execution paths.

The output shows two separate traceback messages. Both tracebacks point to the same root cause: the failure to open a font file using the `ImageFont.truetype` function from the Python Imaging Library (PIL).

**Key details from the tracebacks:**

* **File paths:**  The tracebacks highlight several file paths, including:
    * `/tmp/datagenmrt9km.py`: This appears to be the main script where the error originates.
    * `/root/.cache/uv/environments-v2/ffad51b5c0487eb6/lib/python3.13/site-packages/PIL/ImageFont.py`: This is the PIL ImageFont library file.
* **Function calls:** The error occurs within the `truetype` function of the PIL `ImageFont` module. This function tries to load a TrueType font file.
* **Font files:** Two attempts to load font files are shown:
    * `"arial.ttf"` (likely a system font)
    * `"/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf"` (a specific DejaVu font)
* **Line numbers:** The tracebacks provide specific line numbers within both the `/tmp/datagenmrt9km.py` script and the `ImageFont.py` library file where the error occurs. These line numbers would be useful for debugging.
* **`OSError: cannot open resource`:** This is the core error message. It indicates the system cannot find or access the specified font files.  The reason for this could be:
    * **Incorrect path:** The path to the font file is wrong.
    * **Missing font file:** The specified font file is not installed on the system.
    * **Permissions issues:** The script may not have permissions to access the font file.

**Additional Information:**

The top line indicates that three Python packages were recently installed. This might be relevant if the font files were expected to be part of these packages.

The bottom line provides some additional information, possibly related to a web request or a script execution within a containerized environment.  It starts with `INFO:` and includes a URL that points to a Github Gist. This suggests the script might be part of a larger project or application.

In summary, the image provides a detailed error log indicating that a Python script failed to load font files required to create images.  The specific cause needs further investigation based on system configuration and file permissions.

**Image Description:** The image contains a list of function calls, seemingly from a programming context.  Each function call is prefixed with a number (a2, a3, a4, etc.) and underscores, followed by a descriptive name within parentheses.  The functions appear to relate to data handling and organization:


* **a2_format_markdown():**  Suggests a function for formatting data in Markdown.
* **a3_dates():** Likely handles date-related operations.
* **a4_contacts():**  Implies managing contact information.
* **a5_logs():**  Suggests processing or accessing log files.
* **a6_docs():**  Likely deals with documents or document management.
* **a7_email():**  Implies functions related to email handling.
* **a8_credit_card_image():**  Specifically points to handling or processing images of credit cards.  This is potentially sensitive data.
* **a9_comments():**  Likely processes or manages comments or user feedback.
* **a10_ticket_sales():**  Suggests functions related to ticket sales management and data.

The overall impression is a code snippet demonstrating a structure for organizing functions that handle various types of data. The consistent naming convention suggests a well-organized system.  The inclusion of `credit_card_image()` highlights a potential security concern, as credit card data requires careful handling and security measures.

**Image Description:** The image contains a log output, likely from a program that runs tasks and interacts with HTTP servers.  Here's a breakdown of the content:


**Section 1: Task Description (Yellow Highlight)**

This section describes a task the program is attempting to execute:

* **Task Name:** "Install `uv` (if required) and run the script".  This suggests the program may need to install a dependency (`uv`) before running a Python script.
* **Script URL:** `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/f19b6797f82b36da39ac44f3a7d4392a/raw/13246698088795e1942179856aafd466052b66ae/datagen.py`. This is a GitHub Gist containing the Python script to be executed.
* **Argument:** `23f3003196@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. This email address-like string is passed as the sole argument to the script.


**Section 2: HTTP Request Details**

This part shows the details of an HTTP POST request sent to a local server (`http://localhost:8503/run`).  The request body includes URL-encoded data representing the task information (including the script URL and argument) from Section 1.  The response received was a "500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR".


**Section 3: Error Response (Red Highlight)**

This section displays the error returned from a separate HTTP request (different from the one in Section 2):

* **HTTP Status Code:** 500 (Server Error). This indicates a problem on the server-side.
* **Error Message:** "Agent error: 429 Client Error: Too Many Requests for url: https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/chat/completions". This is a very specific error.  It suggests the program made too many requests to a service that likely uses the OpenAI API (`/openai/v1/chat/completions`) via an intermediary (`aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev`). The `429` status code specifically signifies "Too Many Requests".

**In Summary:**

The log shows that a task involving running a Python script failed. The failure stems from two problems:

1. The initial attempt at running the script resulted in a 500 error from a local server. This is likely a server-side issue.
2. A secondary error, a 429 error, indicates that too many requests were sent to a remote OpenAI API endpoint. This is a rate-limiting issue and requires either reducing the number of requests or waiting.  The 500 error may be connected as the script might be attempting to access the API.

## Post #122 by carlton (Post ID: 612890)
When we build it after pulling it, it will get a unique identifier that makes sure we will only ever evaluate exactly that version. We pull it from your submission in the form.


In other words, if any changes occur to the docker repo, our id will no longer match a newer version of the file. This way we can make sure we are evaluating the right version every time. Your id does not have to match ours.


But we can detect changes made to the docker repo through our image id. I hope that is clear.


We will do some extra sanity checks before the 1/4/2025 just incase there are any issues. But thanks for asking the question.

## Post #126 by Santoshsharma (Post ID: 613139)
Greetings, Sir,


I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between 
pandas
 and 
numpy
 caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (
pandas==2.0.3
 and 
numpy==1.24.3
) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.


To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.


I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (
santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest
). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.


Thank you for your assistance!

## Post #130 by 23ds2000092 (Post ID: 613369)
Hi,


For Tasks A8, A9 & A10, I am not seeing any errors in my Docker execution logs. I am assuming the evaluation script failed to fetch the output file to verify the output for some reason. Can you please try rerunning these three tasks again? These tasks are working fine for me.


For Task B1. “Data outside /data is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it.” - So when the evaluation asked to write something to /tmp/hello.txt it has correctly thrown an error saying access denied. I think this should be marked as correct. As the task description itself says so, the return is passed as 200 OK


ERROR:main:Error executing write_file: Access denied: /tmp/hello.txt
INFO:     172.17.0.1:60918 - "POST /run?task=Write+%27Hello+World%27+to+%60%2Ftmp%2Fhello.txt%60 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK




Similarly for task B2.


INFO:main:Checking file path: /data/format.md
ERROR:main:Error executing file_folder_deletion: Deletion not allowed: /data/format.md
INFO:     172.17.0.1:59446 - "POST /run?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md HTTP/1.1" 200 OK



For Task B4, if branch is not given we are assuming it as ‘main’ branch. Is it not correct? We would have at least expected the branch passed in the request.


For Task B8, I could not see the task description sent in the request in evaluation log file. Can you please check if the task request was passed properly?

Because I see only “=4 B8 failed: not all arguments converted during string formatting” for Task B8

Thanks for your encouragement.. tried debugging the issue of image not starting up in the orchestrator script.. I found that the issue was happening because of the http and https proxies being set in docker build


ARG http_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.<xxx>.com:80
 ARG https_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.<xxx>.com:80

ENV http_proxy=${http_proxy}
 ENV https_proxy=${https_proxy}



This was required  as my office environment was behind the proxy and it was required for uv to download the dependencies on startup..


So this had caused the image to run in my office environment and not in orchestrator environment.. now removed the same and tested in a different vm altogether and noticed that the container  started up without issues..


Checkin url: 
Update Dockerfile removed hard coded proxies · rsjay1976/TDS-Project1-Jan25@a71e3a8 · GitHub


Have pushed the latet image (rsjay1976/tds-project1-jan25:latests) to docker hub as well..  didnt make any source changes or any other changes in the image.. Would be great if this is considered and image be considered for reevaluation… Appreciate your help

on a side note, to validate and test our docker/podman images on a platform outside of our dev environment we can use 
https://labs.play-with-docker.com/
.. this is a free platform to download run and test docker images …

Hi 
@carlton
 
@Jivraj


I might have found a bug in my code, I have hardcoded my file directory into my code but I didn’t change it later. I have created a safe_open function that will throw a HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN error when tried to access files outside that directory. Because of this all the tasks failed. There also might be environment and configuration issues in my Dockerfile. When I tested locally, it worked fine but because of this small mistake I am now only getting 1/20. Is it possible to change/modify my code?


Thanks for considering, any help would be appreciated. Worked very hard for this

**Image Description:** This image shows a text-based evaluation report for a project submission.  The report details the pre-requisites for Project 1 and indicates whether each requirement has been met.

**Key Information:**

* **Project 1 Requirements:** The report outlines five pre-requisites for Project 1:
    1. A publicly accessible GitHub repository.
    2. The repository contains a LICENSE file with the MIT license.
    3. The repository contains a valid Dockerfile.
    4. A publicly accessible Docker image that runs using a specific `podman` command (including environment variables and port mapping).
    5. The Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as the GitHub repository.

* **Evaluation Results:** The evaluation section shows the following results:
    * **Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:** PASS
    * **Is Github repo present AND public:** FAIL
    * **Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo:** FAIL
    * **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** FAIL

* **Overall Status:** Based on the failed prerequisites, the overall evaluation is:
    * **Prerequisites: FAIL**
    * **Project 1 Score: 0**

* **Relevant Links:** The text mentions a "TDS Project 1: Evaluation page," indicating there's likely a webpage with further details about the evaluation criteria.

In summary, the image displays an automated assessment of a project submission that failed because the GitHub repository was not public, lacked a `Dockerfile`, and lacked an MIT license in its root directory.  While the Docker image itself passed the check, the submission failed due to the missing repository components.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/c/8/c8edbd63c9ebf7c97ccc221d7c91fa9ee4c8554c_2_690x439.jpeg)

**Image Description:** This image shows a screenshot of a Git repository's file list, likely from a platform like GitHub or GitLab. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Repository Name:** `tds_proj1`  This is the name of the project.  The word "Public" indicates the repository's visibility.

* **Branch and Tags:** The top bar shows the current branch ("main") and indicates that there is 1 other branch and 0 tags.

* **Commit History:** The rightmost column shows a summary of the recent commits (10 total), all occurring 2 months ago.  The commit `5e4785c` is explicitly mentioned and is dated "2 months ago".

* **File List:** The bulk of the image is a file list. Each row represents a file or directory within the repository.  The file list includes:
    * `_pycache_` (a directory, likely containing Python bytecode)
    * `data` (a directory, likely containing data used by the project)
    * `env` (a directory, probably containing environment variables or configuration files)
    * `Dockerfile` (a file describing a Docker image)
    * `LICENSE` (the project's license file)
    * `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py` (Python script files, names suggesting specific roles within the application)
    * `requirements.txt` (a file listing project dependencies)

* **Commit Messages:**  Each file or directory shows a concise summary of the most recent commit affecting it. Most entries say "update", indicating general modifications. The `LICENSE` file shows "Create LICENSE," indicating its creation in a recent commit.

* **Commit ID (SHA):** The top row shows the SHA-1 commit ID (21f2000304) for the most recent commit which appears to be an update to the entire project.

* **Search Bar:**  A search bar ("Go to file") is visible, allowing users to quickly locate files within the repository.

* **Other Interface Elements:** The interface also features buttons or dropdowns for adding files, switching between code views, and pinning or unwatching the repository.


In summary, the image provides a snapshot of a Python project's structure and recent activity.  The file names suggest a project potentially involving data generation, evaluation, and possibly tasks using a Docker environment.  All changes were made 2 months prior to the screenshot being taken.

**Image Description:** This image shows a screenshot of a terminal or console window displaying a log of HTTP requests and their responses.  The log details an attempt to run a task using a datasette server.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

* **Task Goal:** The primary objective is to count the number of rows in a CSV file (`ticket-sales.csv`) where the 'type' column is 'Bronze'.  This data is located on a local datasette server (port 8001).  The results should be saved to `/data/b10.csv`.

* **HTTP Requests:** The log shows multiple HTTP requests:
    * **GET requests to `/data/b9.html` and `/data/b10.csv` (failed):** These requests attempt to retrieve files, resulting in `404 Not Found` errors, indicating the files do not exist in the specified location. The associated failures are explicitly flagged as `B9 FAILED` and `B10 FAILED`.
    * **POST request to `/run`:** This request attempts to execute the data counting task on the datasette server. It returns a `400 Bad Request` error, indicating a problem with the request itself. The error message details `Max retries exceeded` which suggests a connection problem with the datasette server (port 8001) possibly caused by `Connection refused`.
    * **POST request to a OpenAI embedding endpoint:** This is unrelated to the datasette server task and was successful. It indicates a different API call.

* **Datasette Server Interaction:** The log highlights the interaction with a local datasette server (port 8001).  The server appears unresponsive or inaccessible to the client, preventing the task from completing successfully.

* **Error Messages:**  The most crucial part is the error message associated with the POST request to the `run` endpoint. This clarifies that a connection to the datasette server could not be established (`Connection refused`), leading to the task failure.

* **Score:**  A score of "6/20" is present, possibly indicating a grading or testing context related to the task's outcome.

In summary, the image documents a debugging session related to a data processing task using a datasette server. The primary issue is the inability to connect to and access the datasette server at port 8001, preventing successful execution of the data counting operation and resulting in file retrieval failures.

**Image Description:** This image shows a screenshot of an email or message, likely from an online learning platform. The subject concerns the evaluation of Project 1.

The message informs the recipient that Project 1 requires passing several prerequisite checks, detailed on a linked "IDS Project 1: Evaluation" page.  These checks verify:

1.  The existence and public accessibility of their GitHub repository.
2.  The presence of a LICENSE file with the MIT license in the GitHub repository.
3.  The presence of a valid Dockerfile in the GitHub repository.
4.  The public accessibility and runnability of their Docker image using `podman`.  The command includes environment variables for authentication.
5.  The Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in their GitHub repository.

The email then shows the results of the prerequisite checks:

*   **Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:** PASS
*   **Is Github repo present AND public:** PASS
*   **Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo:** FAIL
*   **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** PASS

Because one check (the Dockerfile presence) failed, the overall prerequisites are marked as **FAIL**, and the Project 1 score is **0**.  The image also shows other elements common in mobile messaging interfaces like reply, comment, and video call icons at the bottom.

**Image Description:** This is a screenshot of an email message, likely from an online learning platform or a similar system. The email informs the recipient ("Dear Learner") about the results of a pre-requisite check for Project 1.

The main content is a list of five requirements for Project 1. Each requirement is related to a specific aspect of a GitHub repository and its associated Docker image.  The email clearly states that failure to meet these minimum requirements will prevent evaluation of the project submission.

The crucial part is the evaluation results section, which summarizes the success or failure of each check:

* **Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:** PASS
* **Is Github repo present AND public:** PASS
* **Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo:** FAIL
* **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** PASS

Based on these results, the overall "Prerequisites" status is marked as **FAIL**, and the "Project 1 Score" is 0. This indicates that the project will not be evaluated due to the missing Dockerfile in the root of the GitHub repository.  The email also refers to an "IDS Project 1: Evaluation" page, suggesting a website where further details about the project and evaluation criteria can be found.  The email address and other personal details have been redacted for privacy.

Your dockerfile is misspelt.

## Post #148 by karthiksirimilla (Post ID: 614014)
Thanks for your quick response sir. I just wanted to clarify that my dockerfile was recognized by Docker, and my image was successfully built, so it seems that Docker itself didn’t have an issue with the filename.


However, I understand that the evaluation script might be case-sensitive and specifically looking for “Dockerfile” with an uppercase “D”. If that’s the issue, should I rename and push the file again to the repo sir.


Please let me know if that’s the right fix or if I need to do anything else sir.

## Post #149 by carlton (Post ID: 614015)
The image id varies depending on the system it was built on. When we build it on our Xeon cloud compute it will get a different image id from yours (unless you have a Xeon system). What is common is the dcoker hub image name and tag we used. We used the one you submitted on your form.


But the image id serves the same purpose. If you alter the dockerhub image, our image will no longer match the one from dockerhub. the image id sha will change. So do not worry about whether your sha matches our sha. It just acts as a way for us to make sure that we are consistently looking at the same image.


Kind regards

**Image Description:** This is a screenshot of an email on a mobile device, showing the results of a project evaluation. The email is addressed to "22t1 se2002" from a system or instructor.

**Key Content:**

* **Email Header:** Shows the time (01:25), recipient ("to me"), and a message counter (2).
* **Project Requirements:** The email outlines five prerequisites for passing Project 1, all related to a GitHub repository and Docker image:
    1. Repository existence and public accessibility.
    2. Presence of an MIT license file.
    3. Presence of a valid Dockerfile.
    4. Public accessibility and runnability of the Docker image using `podman`.  Specific commands for running the image are shown.
    5. Consistency between the Dockerfile in the repository and the Docker image.
* **Evaluation Results:** The email presents the evaluation results:
    * The Docker image is present in DockerHub and is public (PASS).
    * The GitHub repository is NOT present and public (FAIL).
    * The Dockerfile is NOT present at the root of the GitHub repo (FAIL).
    * The MIT license is NOT present at the root of the GitHub repo (FAIL).
* **Overall Score:** The overall result for the prerequisites is FAIL, with a Project 1 score of 0.  This implies the project will not be graded until the issues are addressed.

**Relevant Features:**

* **"TDS Project 1: Evaluation page"**: This likely refers to a webpage with detailed instructions on the project requirements.
* **`AIPROXY_TOKEN`, `$IMAGE_NAME`**: These are likely placeholders or variables within the Docker run command.
* **PASS/FAIL indicators:**  Clearly indicates success or failure of each check.
* **Project 1 Score: 0**:  Shows the overall score for Project 1 based on the prerequisites.

In short, the email informs the recipient that their Project 1 submission failed to meet the minimum requirements due to issues with their GitHub repository and is therefore not going to be evaluated until these issues are resolved.  The specific failing requirements are highlighted, aiding in debugging.

**Image Description:** This image shows a screenshot of a GitHub repository.  Here's a breakdown of the content:

**Top Section (Repository Information):**

* **License:** The repository is licensed under the MIT License.
* **Metrics:** The repository has 0 stars, 0 forks, 1 person watching it, and 1 branch.
* **Tags and Activity:**  There are currently 0 tags associated with the repository. There is a link to view activity.
* **Repository Type:** It's a public repository.

**Main Section (File Listing):**

* **Branch:** The currently selected branch is "main".
* **Commit History:** The most recent commit was made by "Vansh-22f300" 2 months ago.
* **File List:** A list of files and directories within the repository is displayed.  Each item shows a file type icon (folder or file), the filename, and the last modified date (all entries show "2 months ago"). Notable files include:
    * `_pycache_`: A directory typically containing compiled Python bytecode.
    * `.env`: Likely a file containing environment variables.
    * `.gitignore`: A file specifying files and directories to be excluded from version control.
    * `LICENSE`: The license file for the project.
    * `README.md`: A markdown file providing a description of the project.
    * `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`: Python script files, suggesting a Python-based project.  The names suggest data generation, evaluation, and possibly different tasks within the application.
    * `dockerfile`: A file defining a Docker container image for the project.
    * `requirements.txt`: A file listing project dependencies.


**Bottom Section:**

* Navigation controls (though partially obscured).

In short, the image displays the contents of a Python-based project hosted on GitHub, likely containing a data generation and evaluation component, possibly packaged for deployment via Docker. The "2 months ago" timestamp for all files suggests the project hasn't been updated recently.

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a mobile device displaying a terminal or command-line interface.  The content primarily focuses on a series of commands and their results related to a database operation.

**Key Text and Commands:**

* **Top Section:**  Provides instructions for starting a server, counting rows in a database table (`ticket-sales.csv`) using a SQL query via `curl`, and then stopping the server. The SQL query counts the number of rows where the 'type' column equals "Bronze".  The output is saved to `/data/b10.csv`.  It also explains alternative ways to stop the server using process IDs.

* **HTTP Request (GET):** Shows an unsuccessful HTTP GET request attempting to retrieve the `/data/b10.csv` file.  The response indicates a "404 Not Found" error.

* **810 failed:**  Indicates a failure to read the `/data/b10.csv` file.  This is likely related to the 404 error above.

* **Score: 10/20:** This suggests a grading or scoring system related to the task, indicating partial success.

* **HTTP Request (POST):** Shows a successful HTTP POST request to a URL that likely involves an embedding service (possibly related to AI or NLP). The response shows a 200 OK status.

**Objects and Relevant Features:**

* **Terminal/Command Line:** The main focus is the text displayed within a terminal window, suggesting a Linux-based or similar system.

* **Error Messages:**  The "404 Not Found" and "810 failed" messages are crucial. They indicate the primary issue: the file `/data/b10.csv` was not created or is inaccessible.

* **File Path:** The consistent mention of `/data/b10.csv` highlights the file path being used for storing the database query's output.

* **HTTP Status Codes:** The 404 (Not Found) and 200 (OK) HTTP status codes provide essential information about the success or failure of the HTTP requests.

**In Summary:**

The screenshot documents an attempt to query a database, save the results to a CSV file, and then process that file.  The core problem is that the attempt to access `/data/b10.csv` failed (404 error), resulting in a partial score (10/20). The final POST request appears unrelated to the database query issue.  The context suggests a programming exercise or assignment where a student is using a datasette server.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/f/7/f7ff60d992c45e083570f274407f2914b3f3f4c3_2_230x500.jpeg)

**Image Description:** This image shows a screenshot of a terminal or command-line interface, likely on a mobile device.  The content displays a sequence of HTTP requests and their results, along with error messages and a task description.  Key features and text include:

* **Top:** The top shows a user ID or similar identifier "23f2005702@ds.stud..."

* **Initial Instructions:** Instructions are given to save data to a file `/data/b10.csv` and stop a datasette server. This suggests a data processing or analysis task.

* **HTTP Request POST (1):** An HTTP POST request attempted to run a datasette command, but resulted in a "500 Internal Server Error".  The request is quite long and includes SQL-like code to count rows based on a specific condition (`type == "Bronze"`).

* **HTTP Request GET:** A GET request to retrieve the `/data/b10.csv` file failed with a "404 Not Found" error.

* **B10 Failed:**  Clearly indicates that the process of reading  `/data/b10.csv` failed.  This likely explains the "404 Not Found" error above.

* **Score: 1/20:** Suggests a scoring system related to the task, with a very low score achieved.

* **HTTP Request POST (2):**  An HTTP POST request to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings` failed with a "429 Too Many Requests" error. This indicates rate limiting by the OpenAI API.

* **Failed to send request to OpenAI API:** Another indication of the OpenAI API rate limit being exceeded.

* **Running task:** Describes a task that installs a dependency (`uv`) and runs a Python script from a GitHub gist. The script URL is provided. This Python script (`datagen.py`) is the only argument in a command, suggesting this is part of the data generation process.  The user's ID is used as part of the task.


* **HTTP Request POST (3):** This section shows a further POST request which appears to be another attempt to run the script from GitHub described above. This time directed to a localhost port.


In summary, the image documents a failed data processing pipeline. The pipeline involves interacting with a local server, a datasette database, and the OpenAI API. The primary issue seems to be the failure to create and read the `/data/b10.csv` file locally which is coupled with hitting the rate limit of the OpenAI API. The 404 Not Found error (and related failure) likely stopped the processing before the OpenAI request.

**Image Description:** This image shows the results of a Project 1 prerequisite evaluation.  The evaluation checked several conditions:

* **Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:** This check failed (FAIL).  This suggests that either a Docker image was not found on Docker Hub, or if found, it wasn't publicly accessible.

* **Is Github repo present AND public:** This check passed (PASS).  This means a GitHub repository was found and is publicly accessible.

* **Is `Dockerfile` present in root of github repo:** This check passed (PASS).  A `Dockerfile` (the instruction file for building Docker images) was found in the root directory of the GitHub repository.

* **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** This check passed (PASS). An MIT license file was found in the root directory of the GitHub repository.


The overall result is that the prerequisites failed (Prerequisites: FAIL) resulting in a Project 1 score of 0 (Project 1 Score: 0).  The failure is solely due to the missing or private Docker image on Docker Hub.

**Image Description:** This image shows a dark-themed interface, likely from a repository management system like Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry.  It displays information about a repository named `23f2004644/data_automation_agent`.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

* **Repository Name:** `23f2004644/data_automation_agent`  This indicates the repository's unique identifier and suggests it relates to data automation.

* **Last Push:**  "about 1 month ago"  This shows the last time an update was made to the repository.

* **Repository Size:** 757 MB This indicates the size of the repository's contents.

* **Tags Section:** This section lists the tags associated with the repository.  There is only one tag shown:

    * **Tag Name:** `latest`  (indicated by a green circle)  This is a common tag indicating the most recent version.
    * **OS:** A penguin icon representing Linux. This signifies the operating system the image runs on.
    * **Type:** `Image` This confirms the repository contains a container image.
    * **Pulled:** 5 days ago  This shows when the image was last downloaded.
    * **Pushed:** about 1 month ago  This confirms the time the image was last uploaded to the repository.

* **Navigation Tabs:**  At the top, tabs allow navigation to sections like "General," "Tags," "Image Management" (marked BETA), "Collaborators," "Webhooks," and "Settings."

* **Add Description/Category:** Prompts to add a description and category to the repository.

In summary, the image provides a snapshot of a repository containing a single container image (`latest` tag) for a data automation agent, last updated about a month ago. The image runs on a Linux OS.

**Image Description:** The image is a screenshot of a comment section, likely from a forum or online community. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **`231200146444,data_subinformation_agent`**: This appears to be a long alphanumeric string, possibly a user ID or a unique identifier related to a data entry or agent.  The use of "data_subinformation" suggests it might be from a system managing data.

* **`about 1 month ago`**: This indicates the timestamp of the comment, showing it was posted approximately one month before the screenshot was taken.

* **`MACL`**: This is likely an abbreviation or acronym.  Without more context, its meaning is unclear.  It's presented in a manner that suggests it might be a username, a group tag, or an organization's short name.

* **`Public`**: This word indicates the visibility of the comment or the thread where the comment is posted; it's visible to all users.

There's an indistinct word or part of a word to the far right,  but it is too blurry to decipher.

The overall style suggests a dark theme interface, typical of many online platforms.  The information is presented in a concise manner, typical of a comment or status update.

Respected Sir,


I have received a 
FAIL
 status for the prerequisite check:


“Is Docker image present in Docker Hub AND is public.”


However, as shown in my Docker Hub repository, my Docker images are publicly accessible.


I have attached a screenshot for the reference.


Thank you for your time and support.

**Image Description:** This image shows a user's interface, likely from a Docker Hub account.  The main content focuses on a list of repositories.

**Key Elements:**

* **Top Left:** Displays the username "santoshsharma003" and indicates it's a Docker Personal account.  A sidebar lists options including "Repositories," "Settings," "Default privacy," "Notifications," "Billing," and "Usage."

* **Main Section:**  The central area is titled "Repositories" and shows a list of the user's repositories within the "santoshsharma003" namespace.  There's a search bar to filter repositories by name. A dropdown menu allows filtering by "All content."

* **Repository Table:** A table displays information for each repository, including:
    * **Name:** The name of the repository (one example shown is `santoshsharma003/ds-project-one-1`).
    * **Last Pushed:** The date and time of the last update.  The example shows "2 days ago".
    * **Contains:**  Shows the content type; in the example, it's "IMAGE".
    * **Visibility:** Whether the repository is public or private.  The example shows "Public".
    * **Scout:** A status indicator, showing "Inactive" in this case.

* **Button:** A prominent blue button at the top right says "Create a repository," allowing the user to create new repositories.

In short, the image provides a view of a user's Docker Hub repositories, allowing management and creation of new repositories.  The table displays key metadata about each repository.

**Image Description:** The image shows a text-based evaluation of prerequisites for Project 1.  The evaluation checks several conditions related to a Docker image and a GitHub repository.

Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Header:** "These are your Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations:"  This indicates the purpose of the listed items.

* **Individual Checks:**  A series of boolean checks (PASS/FAIL) are presented,  assessing the following:
    * **Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:** PASS -  This confirms that a Docker image exists on Docker Hub and is publicly accessible.
    * **Is Github repo present AND public:** FAIL - Indicates that either a GitHub repository is missing or isn't set to public.
    * **Is `Dockerfile` present in root of github repo:** FAIL - This crucial file, which contains instructions for building the Docker image, is missing from the root directory of the GitHub repository.
    * **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** FAIL - An MIT license file is absent from the root of the GitHub repository.

* **Summary:**  The overall evaluation of prerequisites is summarized:
    * **Prerequisites:** FAIL -  Overall, the project failed to meet the prerequisite requirements.
    * **Project 1 Score: 0** -  A score of zero reflects the failed prerequisite checks.

In short, the image shows that while the Docker image itself is public and present on Docker Hub,  the project failed because its associated GitHub repository lacks essential components: a publicly accessible repository, a Dockerfile, and an MIT license.  This information likely explains why the project received a score of zero.

**Image Description:** This image shows a report of a Project 1 evaluation. 


The top line states that failure to meet minimum requirements will result in the submission not being evaluated.  Below, a list of prerequisite evaluations is presented:

* **Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:**  FAIL
* **Is Github repo present AND public:** PASS
* **Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo:** PASS
* **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** PASS

The overall evaluation is summarized at the bottom:

* **Prerequisites:** FAIL
* **Project 1 Score:** 0

The image indicates that while some prerequisites were met (Github repo, Dockerfile, and MIT license), the absence of a publicly available Docker image in Dockerhub resulted in a failing grade (score 0) for Project 1.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/7/b/7bb1e9a2434b55bd730c069340ad3c290255089c_2_690x57.png)

**Image Description:** Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a dark-themed table or list view, possibly from a file management or version control system.  The table has five columns with headers: "Name," "Last Pushed," "Contains," "Visibility," and "Scout."

A single row of data is visible beneath the headers.  The content of this row is as follows:

* **Name:** `coolsisters7/llm`  This appears to be a name or identifier, possibly a project name or a repository path.
* **Last Pushed:** `about 1 month ago` This indicates the last time the item was updated. An upward-pointing arrow icon is next to this text, suggesting a sorting option.
* **Contains:** `IMAGE` This suggests the item contains an image file.
* **Visibility:** `Public` This indicates the accessibility of the item.
* **Scout:** `Inactive` This suggests a status or a feature related to the item.

The overall appearance suggests a technical or software-related context. The dark background and light-colored text are common in many coding interfaces.  The information provided strongly suggests a file (likely an image) stored in some kind of repository or cloud storage service.

**Image Description:** This image shows an email or document detailing the results of a Project 1 prerequisite check.  The top section outlines five requirements:

1.  A publicly accessible GitHub repository.
2.  The repository contains a LICENSE file with the MIT license.
3.  The repository has a valid Dockerfile.
4.  A publicly accessible Docker image that runs using a provided command (including environment variables and port mapping).
5.  The Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as the GitHub repository.

The bottom section displays the evaluation results:

*   **Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:** FAIL
*   **Is Github repo present AND public:** PASS
*   **Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo:** PASS
*   **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** PASS

The overall assessment is that the prerequisites have **FAILED**, resulting in a **Project 1 Score of 0**.  The text mentions a "TDS Project 1: Evaluation" page, implying further details are available elsewhere.  The failure likely stems from the Docker image not being publicly available on Docker Hub, despite the other requirements being met.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/3/1/317e57a3184948d62a96fd0206a53043bb0d2bac_2_690x335.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a screen capture of a Docker Hub repository page for the image `jayeshbansal/tds_project1`.  Here's a breakdown of the content:

**Top Section:**

* **Repository Name:** `jayeshbansal/tds_project1` is clearly displayed at the very top.  This indicates the owner (`jayeshbansal`) and the name of the Docker image (`tds_project1`).
* **Last Push:**  It shows that the image was last pushed about a month ago.
* **Repository Size:** The repository size is listed as 77 MB.
* **Public View Button:** A "Public view" button suggests the repository is publicly accessible.
* **Edit Options:** Options to "Add a description" and "Add a category" are available, indicating the ability to provide more information about the repository.

**Middle Section:**

* **Navigation Tabs:**  Standard navigation tabs ("General," "Tags," "Image Management," "Collaborators," "Webhooks," "Settings") are present, suggesting a typical Docker Hub interface.
* **Tag Management:** A section for managing tags is shown. There's a search and filter option for tags.  The `latest` tag is selected.
* **Delete Button:** A "Delete" button is visible.

**Bottom Section:**

* **Docker Commands:** A section dedicated to providing Docker commands for interacting with the repository.
    * **Push Command:** A command to push a new tag (`docker push jayeshbansal/tds_project1:tagname`) is displayed.
    * **Pull Command:** A command to pull the `latest` tag (`docker pull jayeshbansal/tds_project1:latest`) is displayed, along with a "Copy" button for convenience.  A "Copy" button is visible next to this command.
* **Image Details (for the `latest` tag):**
    * **Digest:**  A unique identifier (`2bdbd090a678`) for the `latest` tag is provided.
    * **OS/ARCH:** The operating system and architecture (`linux/amd64`) is indicated.
    * **Last Pull:** The last time this image was pulled is noted as "about 1 month."
    * **Compressed Size:** The compressed size of the image is 77.02 MB.

In summary, the image provides a detailed view of a Docker Hub repository page, showcasing metadata about the image, options for editing and managing tags, and the essential Docker commands to push and pull it.  The `latest` tag is highlighted.

Hi 
@Jayeshbansal
 ,


The docker repo name that you submitted through submission form was different than what your screenshot shows. 
/jayeshbansal/add9a05689d3
 docker repo doesn’t exists or might not be public, that’s why it failed for you.

**Image Description:** The image shows a code review or similar interface, possibly from a version control system like Git. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Section:** Shows tabs labeled "Preview," "Code," "Blame," and file size information (1069 lines, 127 KB).  There are also standard interface buttons for raw view, download, and edit.  A search bar contains an email address: `24f1001895@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.

* **Main Section (Table):** This section displays a table with columns for:
    * **#:** Row number (1, 1022 are visible).
    * **Timestamp:** A date and time (e.g., `2/16/2025 23:55:44`).
    * **Email Address:** An email address (partially visible, matches the email in the search bar).
    * **GitHub Repository Link:** A question asks for the link, and the answer is provided: `https://github.com/jayesh-bansal/TDS-Project1/`
    * **DockerHub Image Name:** A question asks for the name, and the answer is provided: `jayeshbansal/add9a05689d3`


In essence, the image captures a record of a submission or answer to questions about a GitHub repository containing code for a "Project 1" and the corresponding DockerHub image name.  The email address suggests a potential user or contributor.

**Image Description:** The image is a screenshot of a Git repository's file list, likely from a platform like GitHub or GitLab.

**Key features and text:**

* **Repository Name:** Project1-TDS (Public) - This indicates the name of the project and its public accessibility.
* **Branch:**  The repository is currently on the 'main' branch.
* **Commits:** There are 5 commits, all made 2 months ago.  This suggests recent activity.
* **User:** PalakAnand30 is the user who made the commits.
* **Files:** The repository includes several files and folders:
    * `_pycache_`: A standard Python directory for compiled bytecode.
    * `app`:  A folder, likely containing the main application code.
    * `.DS_Store`:  A macOS system file; its presence suggests the project was likely developed or worked on using a macOS machine.
    * `Dockerfile`:  A file used for creating Docker containers, implying the application may be containerized.
    * `MIT LICENSE`:  This indicates that the project is licensed under the MIT License.  There's a commit noting it was renamed from a plain `LICENSE` file.
    * `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, and `requirements.txt`:  These files suggest a Python-based project involving data generation, evaluation, and dependencies management.
* **Commit Messages:** The commit messages provide insights into the changes:  "Initial commit", "commiting final files", and "Rename ...".  The renaming suggests a minor organizational change.

In summary, the image shows a small, recently updated Python project that utilizes Docker, likely for data-related tasks, under the MIT License. The recent commit history suggests active development.

**Image Description:** The image shows a code-like output, possibly from an automated testing or grading system. It lists several checks with "PASS" or "FAIL" results:

* **`Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: FAIL`**: This is highlighted in red, indicating a critical failure.  It means a Docker image was not found in Docker Hub, or if found, it was not public.

* **`Is Github repo present AND public: PASS`**:  A GitHub repository was found and is publicly accessible.

* **`Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: PASS`**: A `Dockerfile` exists in the root directory of the GitHub repository.

* **`Is MIT license present at root of github repo: PASS`**: An MIT license is present in the root directory of the GitHub repository.

* **`Prerequisites: FAIL`**: This summarizes the overall status of the prerequisites check.  Due to the Docker image failure, the prerequisites failed.

* **`Project 1 Score: 0`**: The project received a score of 0, likely because the prerequisites failed.

The presence of "ר?" and "..." on the right side appears unrelated to the grading output.  They are possibly random characters or artifacts.

In summary, the image indicates a problem with the Docker image either not existing in Docker Hub or not having public visibility. This failure resulted in the project failing the prerequisites check and receiving a score of zero.

**Image Description:** This image is a screenshot of what appears to be a file management system or repository interface.  It shows a list of items, likely files, with information about each one.  The columns display:

* **Last Pushed:** Indicates when each item was last updated.  One item was updated "about 2 hours ago," and another "2 months ago."  The "about 2 hours ago" entry is underlined in red in the image.

* **Contains:**  States the type of content the item contains. In both cases, it shows "IMAGE," suggesting they are image files.

* **Visibility:** Shows the accessibility of each item. Both items have a "Public" visibility setting.  The "Public" next to "about 2 hours ago" is circled in red.

The red underlines and circles suggest someone is drawing attention to the recency of one image ("about 2 hours ago") and its public visibility.  This could indicate a focus on the most recent public image, perhaps for a search, review, or access control purpose.

**Image Description:** The image shows a GitHub repository page for a project named "tds-trail-1" owned by user "Mayank8IITM".  The repository is marked as "Public".

The left side of the image displays the files within the repository:

* Folders: `_pycache_`, `data`
* Files: `.dockerignore`, `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `main.py`, `requirements.txt`

The right side of the image shows the commit history, each entry indicating the action performed (e.g., "Rename dockerfile to Dockerfile", "Create LICENSE"), the commit ID (e.g., 6937764), and the timestamp ("2 months ago").  The total number of commits is 10.

The top section shows standard GitHub repository navigation elements: Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights, and Settings.  There's also a search bar.

The highlighted elements in red circles are:

* **"Public"**:  Indicates the visibility of the repository.
* **`LICENSE`, `Dockerfile`:** Likely important files for software projects; `LICENSE` contains licensing information, and `Dockerfile` contains instructions to build a Docker image.

The image provides a clear overview of the repository's contents, commit history, and project status.  The presence of a `Dockerfile` and `requirements.txt` suggests it's a software project that uses Docker and external libraries.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/e/4/e4a17e2340281059ba12ec777f0a33a1c662f3ea_2_690x172.png)

**Image Description:** This image shows a snippet of text that appears to be an automated evaluation of a project's prerequisites. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Header:**  The text begins with "These are your Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations:".  This indicates that the following list assesses whether the project met certain requirements before evaluation.

* **Evaluation Items:** The core of the image contains a list of boolean checks (true/false), each evaluating a specific condition:
    * `Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS` - This check passed.  It means a Docker image was found in Docker Hub and was publicly accessible.
    * `Is Github repo present AND public: FAIL` - This check failed.  A GitHub repository was either missing or not public.
    * `Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL` - This check failed. A `Dockerfile` (the file that contains instructions for building a Docker image) wasn't found in the root directory of the GitHub repository.
    * `Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL` - This check failed. An MIT license file wasn't found in the root directory of the GitHub repository.

* **Summary:** The evaluation concludes with:
    * `Prerequisites: FAIL` - This summarizes the overall result of the prerequisite checks. At least one prerequisite failed.
    * `Project 1 Score: 0` -  This indicates a score of zero, likely due to the failed prerequisites.  This means the project will not be scored.

* **Handwritten markings:**  Red underlines and a red bracket highlight the `FAIL` statuses for clarity.

In short, the image displays a project evaluation report indicating that the project failed to meet several essential prerequisites, resulting in a score of 0.  The missing components were a public GitHub repository, a `Dockerfile` in its root, and an MIT license file.

The task B6 was


https://quotes.toscrape.com/
 has quotes from famous people.

The .author class has the quote author’s name.

Extract and save all authors from the first page, in order, to /data/b6.json as an array of strings.

E.g. 
["Douglas Adams", "J.K. Rowling", ...]


The output in your file is not an array of double quoted strings.


Instead it is an array of an json object with the keyword author and values as an array of authors.


These are two different things. Almost there but not quite.

**Image Description:** This image shows an email titled "TDS Jan 25 Project 1 Scores."  The email is from the TDS Team and addresses a learner's submission for Project 1. The main content details the prerequisites for the project, which include:

1.  A publicly accessible GitHub repository.
2.  The repository containing a LICENSE file with the MIT license.
3.  A valid Dockerfile in the repository.
4.  A publicly accessible Docker image that runs via a specific podman command.
5.  The Docker image using the same Dockerfile as the GitHub repository.

The email then presents the results of the prerequisite checks:

*   **Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:** PASS
*   **Is Github repo present AND public:** PASS
*   **Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo:** FAIL
*   **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** PASS

Because the Dockerfile was not found in the root of the GitHub repository, the overall **Prerequisites** evaluation is **FAIL**, and the **Project 1 Score** is **0**.  The email concludes with a closing remark from the TDS Team.  The sender's email address is partially visible as "22t1 se2002".  The email was sent at 1:24 am.

**Image Description:** The image contains a text-based report of prerequisite evaluations for Project 1.  The report shows the results of four checks:

1. **Docker Image:** Checks if a Docker image exists on Docker Hub and is publicly accessible.  The result is **PASS**.

2. **GitHub Repo:** Checks if a GitHub repository exists and is public. The result is **PASS**.

3. **Dockerfile:** Checks if a `Dockerfile` is present in the root directory of the GitHub repository. The result is **FAIL**.  This is likely the reason the project failed the prerequisites.

4. **MIT License:** Checks if an MIT license is present in the root directory of the GitHub repository. The result is **PASS**.

The overall implication is that the project failed its prerequisite checks because the `Dockerfile` was missing from the root of its GitHub repository.  All other checks passed.

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of what appears to be a code repository interface, possibly on a platform like GitHub. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Bar:** Shows options for selecting "main" (likely a branch) and "Code", along with a three-dot menu.

* **File List:** A list of files and their last modified date ("2 months ago" for all).  Files include:
    * `Dockerfile`: Suggests a Docker container is involved.
    * `LICENSE`: Indicates the project has a license.
    * `README.md`: A Markdown file containing project information.
    * `app.py`:  Suggests a Python application.
    * `requirements.txt`: A file listing project dependencies.
    * `task_handler.py`: Likely contains code for task management.

* **README Section:** Displays the content of the `README.md` file:
    * **Project Title:** "TDS Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent" - Indicates a project using Large Language Models (LLMs) for automation.  "TDS" might be an abbreviation for a specific course or project designation.
    * **Project Goal:** "Create an API" - The main goal of the project is to create an Application Programming Interface.

* **License:** The README section shows it's under an MIT license.

* **User:** The repository is attributed to a user named `lakshay654`.

In short, the image shows a project that uses large language models to build an automated agent, packaged for deployment using Docker, and open-sourced under the MIT license.  The primary deliverable is an API.

 My P1 submission successfully passed all the basic sanity checks on February 15th and obtained a satisfactory score in the P1 evaluation, which was disclosed on March 29th. However, I received a communication today, April 1, stating that my Docker image is not present or public on DockerHub. I kindly request the TDS course team to investigate this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution for students encountering similar issues.


This situation is particularly disheartening—
seeing days of effort and dedication to Project 1 reduced to nothing, especially given the already demanding pace of the course.


I will appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.


Kind regards

## Post #184 by Jayeshbansal (Post ID: 614290)
I understand the problem. It may be possible that the image id i gave may be different as i had multiple dockerfile and there is a possibility that i gave the wrong image id due to some confusion. Is it possible for reevaluation. I have worked very hard and I don’t want to lose my marks because of some wrong id misconfusion. I request to check my dockerfile once again and provide the marks accordingly

**Image Description:** The image shows a list of files, their versions, and the last modified date.  The files appear to be related to a software project or script.  Specifically:

* **datagen.py:** A Python file likely responsible for data generation (version v1, last modified 2 months ago).
* **dockerfile:** A Dockerfile used for creating a Docker image (updated 2 months ago; the description is misspelled as "docker updatae").
* **evaluate.py:** Another Python file, probably for evaluating the results of some process (version v1, 2 months ago).
* **requirements.txt:**  A text file listing project dependencies (version v1.1, 2 months ago).
* **tasksA.py and tasksB.py:** Two Python files, likely containing different tasks or parts of the project (both version v1, 2 months ago).

All files were last modified 2 months before the screenshot was taken.  The versions indicate that these files may have undergone updates in the past.  The dark background suggests the image is from a file explorer or similar interface.

**Image Description:** This image shows an email message informing a learner about the failure of their Project 1 prerequisites.

**Key Information:**

* **Sender:** The email is addressed to the learner from "22t1 se2002" at 1:27 am.
* **Subject/Topic:** Project 1 prerequisites evaluation.
* **Project Requirements:** The email details five requirements for Project 1:
    1. Publicly accessible GitHub repository.
    2. MIT license file in the GitHub repository.
    3. Valid Dockerfile in the GitHub repository.
    4. Publicly accessible Docker image runnable via `podman run`.
    5. Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as the GitHub repository.
* **Evaluation Results:** The evaluation shows that only the Docker image is publicly available ("PASS"). The remaining requirements failed ("FAIL"):
    * GitHub repository presence and public access.
    * Presence of Dockerfile in the GitHub repository.
    * Presence of MIT license in the GitHub repository.
* **Overall Result:** Due to the failed prerequisites, the project score is 0 and the submission will not be evaluated.  The email explicitly states that failure to meet minimum requirements means the submission will not be evaluated.

**Technical Details:**

The message contains commands and file names relevant to Docker and GitHub, indicating a software development context.  The use of `podman run` suggests a containerization environment.  The variable `$AIPROXY_TOKEN` implies the use of some sort of proxy or authentication token.


In short, the email communicates the failure of a student's project submission due to unmet pre-requisites relating to their GitHub repository and Docker image setup.

**Image Description:** This image shows a table with four columns: "Name," "Last Pushed," "Contains," and "Visibility." There is one row of data.

* **Name:** `rsjay1976/tds-project1-jan25` This appears to be a repository or project name.  The structure suggests a username (`rsjay1976`), a project name (`tds-project1`), and a date component (`jan25`).

* **Last Pushed:** `2 days ago` This indicates the last time the repository or project was updated.

* **Contains:** `IMAGE`  A gray rectangle with the word "IMAGE" inside it. This suggests the repository contains at least one image file.

* **Visibility:** `Public`  This indicates that the repository or project's contents are publicly accessible.

In short, the image is a snippet of a system (likely a version control system or cloud storage) showing a public repository named `rsjay1976/tds-project1-jan25` that contains at least one image and was last updated two days prior to when the screenshot was taken.

Sir I thought that the ‘LICENSE’ file had to be renamed to ‘MIT LICENSE’.

Can you please look into it. Thankyou!

**Image Description:** The image shows a screen capture of a Git repository's file browser, likely on a platform like GitHub or GitLab.  Here's a breakdown of the content:

**Top Section:**

* **`tds_project-1`**: This is the name of the repository.
* **`Public`**: Indicates the repository's visibility.
* **`main`**: Shows the currently selected branch.
* **`1 Branch` and `0 Tags`**:  Display the number of branches and tags in the repository.
* **`Go to file`**: A search bar to find specific files.
* **`Add file`**: A button to add new files.
* **`Code`**:  A dropdown likely containing options for viewing code in different formats.
* **`Pin` and `Unwatch`**: Buttons to pin the repository or stop watching it for updates.

**Middle Section:**

* **`22f3000585 Create LICENSE`**: This line shows a commit hash (`22f3000585`) and the commit message ("Create LICENSE"). It indicates that a license file was created in this commit.
* **File List:** A list of files and directories within the repository.  The file types and names are:
    * `_pycache_` (directory): A Python cache directory.
    * `venv` (directory): A virtual environment directory (often used in Python projects).
    * `Dockerfile` (file):  A file that specifies instructions to build a Docker image.
    * `LICENSE` (file):  A license file (appears to have been renamed).
    * `MIT LICENSE` (file): The MIT License file.
    * `app.py` (file): Likely the main application file (Python).
    * `requirements.txt` (file): Lists project dependencies.
    * `test.txt` (file): Possibly a test file.


**Rightmost Column:**

* **`c61a6ef - now`**: The current commit hash and timestamp.
* **`6 Commits`**: Total number of commits in the repository.
* **Commit History:** A list showing the commit message and timestamp for each commit.  The timestamps show multiple commits 2 months ago, and a recent "now" commit.  The timestamps alongside commits provide the history of file changes and additions.


**Overall:**

The image provides a snapshot of a relatively small project with several common files used in Python development and containerization (Docker). The commit history gives insight into the project's development stages.  The use of `MIT LICENSE` suggests it's an open-source project.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/3/4/3401452ad3977fe3c1b1abed1f71a21c212e2b67.png)

**Image Description:** This image shows a text-based report of a project evaluation.  The top line warns that failure to meet minimum requirements results in non-evaluation.  The body details the results of four checks performed as prerequisites for Project 1:

1. **Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:** PASS
2. **Is Github repo present AND public:** PASS
3. **Is `Dockerfile` present in root of github repo:** PASS
4. **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** FAIL

The overall result is displayed as:

* **Prerequisites:** FAIL
* **Project 1 Score:** 0

This means that although some prerequisites passed, the absence of an MIT license resulted in an overall failure for the prerequisites and a score of 0 for Project 1. The highlighted `Dockerfile` indicates that the presence of this file was checked specifically.

**Image Description:** The image shows a text-based evaluation of prerequisites for Project 1.  The evaluation checks several conditions, each with a PASS or FAIL result:

* **Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:** PASS - This indicates that a Docker image was successfully found on Docker Hub and is publicly accessible.

* **Is Github repo present AND public:** FAIL -  A GitHub repository was either not found or was not public.

* **Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo:** FAIL - A `Dockerfile` was not found in the root directory of the GitHub repository.

* **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** FAIL - An MIT license was not found in the root directory of the GitHub repository.

The overall result is summarized as:

* **Prerequisites:** FAIL
* **Project 1 Score:** 0

This suggests that Project 1 failed its prerequisite checks because of the missing GitHub repository, `Dockerfile`, and MIT license.  The presence of a Docker image in Dockerhub was the only successful check.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/9/4/94566b0ed49bb7659aa9c8a0941fa3b41bfb563e_2_690x472.jpeg)

**Image Description:** The image is a screenshot of text, likely from a troubleshooting guide or support documentation.  The text describes log files related to performance and troubleshooting of a system.

Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Section:** States that the system has 1 Gigabit of dedicated network bandwidth, which is five times faster than the fastest domestic internet. This context suggests a high-performance system.

* **Section 1: Evaluation Log File:** Provides a Google Drive link (partially obscured) to an evaluation log file.  The log is said to contain a performance report on individual tasks.

* **Section 2: Docker Log File:**  Gives another Google Drive link (partially obscured) to a Docker log file. This log provides the technical performance details of a container.  The use of "Docker" indicates this is related to containerized applications.

* **Section 3: Server Start Log File:** Mentions a server start log file with separate logs for ARM and x86 architectures. It also notes that an attachment is available for the logs.  This suggests that there are two different types of server setups (ARM based and x86 based) being considered. The section points out the check should be made if the docker service failed to start.

**Key Features and Observations:**

* **Google Drive Links:** The use of Google Drive suggests that the log files are stored and accessed via Google Drive.  Parts of these links are obscured in the screenshot which prevents their full identification.

* **Log File Types:** The types of log files (Evaluation, Docker, and Server Start) are clearly identified, indicating a structured approach to troubleshooting and monitoring system performance.

* **ARM vs. x86:** The mention of ARM and x86 architectures suggests that the system supports both types of processor architectures.

* **Partial Obscuration:**  Parts of the Google Drive URLs are obscured. This is likely due to either intentional privacy measures or an accidental redaction during the screenshot.

In summary, the image provides instructions on accessing various log files to troubleshoot issues with a likely high-performance system that uses Docker containers and may support ARM and x86 architectures. The incomplete URLs unfortunately prevent the easy retrieval of the logs.

**Image Description:** The image shows a code repository file browser, likely from a platform like GitHub or GitLab.  The top section displays the branch name ("main") and a "Code" button.  Below that, the user "lakshay654" is indicated, along with a timestamp showing the last update was 2 months ago.

A list follows showing the files within the repository:

* `Dockerfile`
* `LICENSE`
* `README.md`
* `app.py`
* `requirements.txt`
* `task_handler.py`

Each file is listed with a timestamp indicating it was last modified 2 months ago.  This suggests a project that has not been recently updated.

At the bottom, there's a README file, and the license is indicated as MIT.  Finally, large text displays "TDS Project 1 - LLM-based," clearly indicating the nature of the project: it's likely a project numbered 1 for a course or program titled "TDS," and the project utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs).

I understand sir Dockerfile name was misspelt sir. Since my Docker image was built and recognized, I didn’t realize this would prevent evaluation.

I worked hard on this project sir, and my Docker image was built successfully. Please consider my submission sir.

I  have been trying to resolve all the errors but just noticed that my docker image id associated with the project is “c9dc7fbcf405” , meanwhile the mail I received mentions that some other image id was evaluated.

Can you please look into this matter and evaluate the correct Image ID.

 I completely understand that changes to the Docker image after the deadline cannot be accepted.


However, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29.


image
1272×395 25.7 KB


But here’s the catch:** Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project 2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:*




Implementing a ReAct-based workflow planning & orchestration agent, inspired by the paper 
ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models
.


Implementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc.


Enhancing Shell-use & Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1. This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything.


Adding useful API endpoints, including an 
/api/
 multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing 
/read
 and 
/run
 endpoints from Project 1, plus a 
/clear
 endpoint to reset the agent’s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated.


Deploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP
, utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI’s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up.




All this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent—it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I’m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like 
hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents
, and it would do that for you—without 
ever
 declining the request. I like to think of it as a 
terminal version of
 
OpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent
.




Given all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it’s incredibly discouraging to see my project 
naturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates)
 and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate.


To clarify, 
all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29
, 
after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out.
 Furthermore, we were 
never informed
 that a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it.


My only request is that if my 
updated P1 submission cannot be evaluated
 due to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my 
original P1 eval score could be reinstated
 instead of receiving a 
0
—since it was already evaluated and graded.


Would highly appreciate your prompt support in this regard

**Image Description:** The image contains a numbered list of seven files, each with a brief description and, in most cases, a Google Drive link.  The files relate to the evaluation of a Docker image submission, possibly as part of a competition or assessment.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Evaluation log file:** Contains a performance report on individual tasks.  A Google Drive link is provided.

2. **Docker log file:** Provides the technical performance of the container. A Google Drive link is provided.

3. **Server start log file:**  Records whether the Docker service started successfully.  Separate logs exist for ARM and x86 architectures.  The note mentions a separate attachment for the file.

4. **Evaluation script file:** Contains the actual tests used to evaluate the submission, including the scoring mechanism.  Separate logs for ARM and x86 architectures.  The note mentions a separate attachment for the file.

5. **Data generation file:**  Used to create the data for the tasks evaluated.  Note mentions a separate attachment.

6. **Docker orchestration file:**  Handles retrieving the Docker image, launching the container, and setting up necessary environment variables and port mappings. Note mentions a separate attachment.

7. **Solution script:** A sample solution for the project, using prompt engineering.  It is provided as a zip file in an attachment.

Finally, the text at the bottom provides the ID of the evaluated Docker image: `11aa22fc1545`.

In summary, the image provides a detailed breakdown of the files involved in evaluating a Docker image submission.  The inclusion of Google Drive links and references to attachments implies that additional information is available elsewhere.

**Image Description:** This is a screenshot of a message, likely an automated evaluation report for a student project. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Line:** The message begins by stating that the submission will not be evaluated.

* **Project 1 Prerequisite Evaluations:** This section details the checks performed to ensure the project met the prerequisites.  Each check has a PASS or FAIL result.

    * **Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:** PASS -  This means a Docker image was found on Docker Hub and is publicly accessible.
    * **Is Github repo present AND public:** PASS -  A GitHub repository was found and it was public.
    * **Is `Dockerfile` present in root of github repo:** FAIL - This is the reason for the overall failure. A crucial file (`Dockerfile`) was missing from the root directory of the GitHub repository.
    * **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** PASS - An MIT license was found in the GitHub repository's root.

* **Overall Results:**

    * **Prerequisites:** FAIL - The overall status of the prerequisite checks is a failure.
    * **Project 1 Score: 0** -  The project received a score of zero due to not meeting the prerequisites.


* **Closing:** The message ends with a polite closing from the "TDS Team."


In summary, the project failed the prerequisite checks because the `Dockerfile` was missing from the GitHub repository.  Therefore, the submission wasn't evaluated.

Hi

Since you updated docker repo few days ago and docker api doens’t support timestamp based pulling we will pull your GitHub repo before 18 th feb and will build through it and run evaluations.


We also have your docker repo evaluation score, will discuss which one to keep.


This is for anyone who updated their docker repo and there are around 10-20 such cases

Hi

As we said before that changes in Docker image after deadline won’t be accepted. Even an extension of the deadline won’t help in this case, simply because Docker API doesn’t support timestamp based pulling. However we would be pulling your GitHub repositories before 18th Feb build a Docker container and run evaluations on that.

 Yup! The Docker issue is perfectly understandable. Even I checked my Hub repo, and I couldn’t seem to find an image having the pre-18th Feb digest. Had I been aware of this issue, and the fact that a re-eval would be carried out, I would’ve tagged the updated image differently. Hopefully, cases like mine will aid in resolving any issues in the future.


Once again, thank you both!

Hi 
@lakshaygarg654


Dont worry you passed pre-requsites. The script that was used earlier for basic checks used a stricter criteria, the newer one we wrote allowed for a looser check. You have scored very well in your latest run. 12 correct tasks.


We have not responded quickly because we are in the midst of finalising all the scores and doing normalisation etc, i.e operational work for Project 1 and 2.


We hope to have Project 2 scores out by this weekend.

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a Git repository's view, likely from a platform like GitHub or GitLab.  Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Repository Name and Visibility:** At the top left, "tds_project1" is the name of the repository, and "Public" indicates its visibility.

* **Branch, Tags:**  A section shows the current branch ("main"), the number of branches (1), and the number of tags (0).

* **Commit History:** The main part of the image displays a list of commits. Each entry includes:
    * **Commit Hash:**  A unique identifier (e.g., `21f1002409`).
    * **Commit Message:** A short description of the changes (e.g., "done," "Initial commit," "readme changes").
    * **Date/Time:**  When the commit was made ("2 months ago").
    * **Files Changed:** (Implicit)  Each commit's description provides insight into which files were changed (e.g., "readme changes").
    * **Commit Summary:** Shows details such as the commit ID (`4d2f5e5`), date (`2 months ago`), and the total number of commits (14).

* **Files in the Repository:** Below the commit history, the repository's files and folders are listed:
    * `tds-project-1` (folder)
    * `LICENSE` (file)
    * `README.md` (file)
    * At the bottom,  `README` and `MIT license` are shown, possibly indicating a link to those files.

* **Repository Actions:**  The top right contains buttons or menu items for actions such as "Pin," "Unwatch," "Add file," and "Code" (likely for viewing the code).  A search bar ("Go to file") allows searching for specific files within the repository.

In summary, the image provides a snapshot of a Git repository's recent activity, file structure, and basic metadata. The information suggests a small project with a few commits, a LICENSE file (likely indicating open-source licensing), and a README file providing project information.  The MIT license specifically suggests an open-source project under the MIT License.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/8/5/85aed36152ce7c20f03accf0e9d01a5fc596109c_2_690x224.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a file directory listing, likely from a version control system like Git. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Bar:** Shows the project path `tds_project1/tds-project-1/` and an "Add file" button, suggesting a file management interface.

* **Commit Information:**  A commit ID (`2111002409`) and the status "done" are displayed, indicating a completed commit.  A timestamp ("4d2f5e5 · 2 months ago") and a "History" button are also present.

* **File Listing:** A table lists files and directories within the project:
    * `...`: Represents a parent directory.
    * `app`: A folder (likely containing application code).
    * `.gitignore`: A file specifying files to exclude from version control.
    * `Dockerfile`: A file defining a Docker container.
    * `README.md`: A markdown file providing project information.

* **Columns:** The table has three columns:
    * **Name:** The name of the file or directory.
    * **Last commit message:** Shows the commit message associated with the last change for each item (all say "done" in this example).
    * **Last commit date:** Indicates when each item was last updated ("2 months ago" for all files listed except for the top-level folder).

The overall context suggests a view of a software project's file structure within a version control system, with each file's last commit message and date provided.  All the listed files except the top-level folder were last updated two months ago.

**Image Description:** The image displays a JSON-formatted error message, likely from a server-side application. 


Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **HTTP 500:** This indicates a general server error (Internal Server Error)  HTTP status code.

* **"details":** This field contains a nested JSON object describing the specifics of the error.

* **"Task handling error: Failed to get LLM response after 3 attempts: Error code: 401":** This suggests an issue occurred while attempting to retrieve a response from a Large Language Model (LLM), possibly three times.  The error code 401 is an "Unauthorized" status code, indicating authentication failure.

* **`{'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}`:** This nested structure shows the LLM's error response. The core problem is  "Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer," which points to a problem with the authentication token used to access the LLM. The other fields (`type`, `param`, `code`) provide more technical details about the error.

* **"error": "Internal server error":** This is a secondary error message from the server itself, indicating that the server itself had a problem handling the error from the LLM.  It's essentially saying the server couldn't handle the authentication failure gracefully.

In short, the image reveals a multi-layered error. The root cause is an invalid authentication token, causing the LLM call to fail. The server then failed to handle this failure correctly, leading to an HTTP 500 error.

Here it is with the task, however the error doesn’t seem to be related to the task itself based on the returned message in the JSON. It seems to be something wrong with the OpenAI API key. From the reading I did, it seems that the key was perhaps not set properly during evaluation? Not completely sure but please look into it.

**Image Description:** The image contains a log of a task that failed. 


Here's a breakdown of the information:


**Task:** The primary task was to format the file `/data/format.md` using the `prettier` tool (version 3.4.2) in-place.

**First Attempt (POST request):** A POST request was sent to `http://localhost:8365/run` to execute the formatting task.  This resulted in an HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error). The server response included details indicating a "Task handling error".  The underlying cause was a 401 error from an LLM (Large Language Model) which indicates that the authentication token used was invalid.

**Second Attempt (GET request):** Following the failure, a GET request was made to `http://localhost:8365/read?path=/data/format.md`.  This resulted in an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) error.

**Overall Failure:** The log concludes with "A2 failed: Cannot read /data/format.md" and "A2 FAILED", confirming the overall failure of the task to format the file.

**Key Error Messages:**

* **HTTP 500 Internal Server Error:** The main failure.  The root cause is an authentication problem.
* **HTTP 400 Bad Request:** A secondary error suggesting a problem accessing the file after the first failure.
* **401 Unauthorized:** The authentication token used by the LLM was invalid.  This is the ultimate reason for the task's failure.

In short, the task failed due to an invalid authentication token, preventing access to the file for formatting.  Both the initial attempt to format and the subsequent attempt to read the file failed.

We have communicated it in the live sessions. It was also communicated via an email when students failed first prerequisite check pass back in February 16th. At that time we gave students a time window to fix it.


We discussed it internally with 
@s.anand
 and he stated that it is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github and he expects students to do it 
regardless of whether we explicitly mentioned it or not
 on the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise.


In our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by 
@s.anand


So unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image.


Kind regards,

TDS team

 Sir, I would like to respectfully ask if this is some sort of April Fool’s joke, as it appears that the TDS team is still only verifying the presence of files in the git repository and checking the accessibility of the repository. I fully understand the importance of marks and the effort we put into Project 1. That’s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0 Score.


I am not the only one facing this issue; several others have encountered the same problem. I kindly request you to review my submission again.


Additionally, I have faced multiple technical issues in recent times. Initially, I was failed in the L1 viva due to a typing mistake, which was later acknowledged. Similarly, in both OPPE 1 and OPPE 2, many students experienced Google Meet issues. On March 29, during my SC OPPE, I faced camera issues in Google Meet, along with VM lagging. Many students have raised similar concerns with Proctor.


Given this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation. I sincerely request you to re-evaluate my submission.

**Image Description:** This image shows an email regarding the results of a project submission.  The email's subject line is "TDS Jan 25 Project 1 Scores." The email is addressed to "22t1 se2002".

The body of the email explains that Project 1 requires passing several pre-requisite checks, which are detailed on a separate "TDS Project 1: Evaluation" page.  These checks include:

1.  The existence of a publicly accessible GitHub repository.
2.  The presence of a LICENSE file (with the MIT license) in the GitHub repository.
3.  The presence of a valid Dockerfile in the GitHub repository.
4.  A publicly accessible Docker image that runs via a specified podman command.
5.  The Docker image using the same Dockerfile as the one in the GitHub repository.

The email then presents the results of the pre-requisite evaluations:

*   **Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:** PASS
*   **Is Github repo present AND public:** FAIL
*   **Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo:** FAIL
*   **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** FAIL

The overall result is that the prerequisites have **FAILED**, meaning the submission will not be evaluated.  The email clearly indicates that the issues are related to the GitHub repository not being properly configured (missing files and/or not being public).

**Image Description:** This image shows the results of a project evaluation.  The top section describes how a Docker image should be accessible, specifying the use of `podman run` with environment variables `AIPROXY_TOKEN` and `IMAGE_NAME`, and port mappings.  It also emphasizes that the Docker image must use the same Dockerfile as the one in the GitHub repository.

The core of the image details the evaluation results:

* **Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:**  **FAIL** - This indicates the Docker image was not found on Docker Hub or was not publicly accessible.

* **Is Github repo present AND public:** **PASS** - The GitHub repository was found and was public.

* **Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo:** **PASS** - The Dockerfile was found in the root of the GitHub repository.

* **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** **PASS** - An MIT license was present in the root of the GitHub repository.

The overall summary shows:

* **Prerequisites:** **FAIL** - Because the Docker image was not found on Docker Hub or was not publicly accessible, the prerequisites failed.

* **Project 1 Score: 0** -  The project received a score of zero due to failing the prerequisites.

In short, the image displays an automated evaluation of a project submission, highlighting the failure to meet the minimum requirement of having a public Docker image.  The other checks passed, but the missing or inaccessible Docker image resulted in a failing grade.

## Post #240 by Vedant22 (Post ID: 614093)
Sir,it appears that the TDS team is still only verifying the presence of files in the git repository and checking the accessibility of the repository. I fully understand the importance of marks and the effort we put into Project 1. That’s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0


@carlton
 Sir please look into this.

@carlton
 Sir, given  this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation. I sincerely request you to re-evaluate my submission.

**Image Description:** This image shows a text-based report, likely from an automated evaluation system for a software project.  The report details the results of checking prerequisites for Project 1.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

* **Top Section:** This section provides instructions, specifically mentioning how the software should be accessible ("accessible and runs via podman run...") using environment variables and port mapping.  It also emphasizes that the Docker image must use the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository. A final statement warns that failure to meet minimum requirements will result in the submission not being evaluated.

* **Prerequisite Evaluations:** This is the core of the report, listing several checks and their results:
    * **`Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:` FAIL:**  This indicates that the Docker image was not found in Docker Hub, or it was not publicly accessible. This is a crucial failure.
    * **`Is Github repo present AND public:` PASS:** The GitHub repository was found and is public.
    * **`Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo:` PASS:** The Dockerfile was found in the root directory of the GitHub repository.
    * **`Is MIT license present at root of github repo:` PASS:** An MIT license was found in the root directory of the GitHub repository.

* **Summary:** The final section summarizes the results:
    * **`Prerequisites: FAIL`:**  Due to the failure of the Docker Hub check, the overall prerequisites are marked as failed.
    * **`Project 1 Score: 0`:** This reflects the consequence of failing the prerequisites; the project receives a score of zero.

In short, the project failed its initial evaluation because the Docker image was not found or accessible on Docker Hub, even though other aspects like the GitHub repository and license were properly set up.

**Image Description:** This is an email detailing the results of a project submission.  The subject line clearly states it's about "TDS Jan 25 Project 1 Scores". The email is addressed to "Dear Learner" and informs them about the outcome of their project 1 submission.

The core content is a list of five prerequisites that the student's submission needed to meet. Each prerequisite is checked, and all five failed (indicated by "FAIL"). These prerequisites involve:

1.  **GitHub Repository:**  The repository needs to exist and be publicly accessible.
2.  **LICENSE File:** The repository must include a LICENSE file with the MIT license.
3.  **Valid Dockerfile:** A valid Dockerfile must be present in the repository.
4.  **Public Docker Image:** The Docker image should be publicly available and runnable using a specific command (provided in the email).
5.  **Matching Dockerfile:** The Dockerfile used for the image must match the one in the GitHub repository.

The email explicitly states that failure to meet these minimum requirements will result in the submission not being evaluated.

Below the list of prerequisites, the evaluation results are clearly summarized:

*   **Prerequisites:** FAIL
*   **Project 1 Score:** 0

The email ends with a closing, "Kind regards, TDS Team".  The email header shows it was sent on January 25th at 1:27 AM.  The sender's email address is clearly visible.  A link to the "TDS Project 1: Evaluation page" is present, which could provide further context and explanation of the requirements.

**Image Description:** This image shows an email detailing the results of a project evaluation.  The email is from the TDS (likely an acronym for a team or course) team.

The main body of the email outlines five prerequisites for Project 1:

1.  A publicly accessible GitHub repository.
2.  The GitHub repository contains a LICENSE file with the MIT license.
3.  The GitHub repository contains a valid Dockerfile.
4.  A publicly accessible Docker image that runs using a specified `podman` command (including environment variables and port mapping).
5.  The Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as the GitHub repository.

Below this, the email presents the evaluation results:

*   **Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:** PASS (This prerequisite was met).
*   **Is Github repo present AND public:** FAIL (The repository was not public).
*   **Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo:** FAIL (The Dockerfile was missing from the repository).
*   **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** FAIL (The MIT license was missing from the repository).

The overall result is: **Prerequisites: FAIL** and **Project 1 Score: 0**.

The email ends with a standard disclaimer to not reply and to contact the course team via Discourse for assistance.

Hi Prashant,


Your prerequisites have passed and your evaluation is 6 tasks have been completed successfully. The email was auto sent because we were doing some checks with an older, stricter script. The newer script passes your evaluation.


Kind regards

## Post #244 by gouthamnischay (Post ID: 614838)
Thanks for the quick reply, i don’t have a convincing argument to counter. Just a suggestion it would have been better if you have explicitly put in the sanity check requirements. Something so obvious to you might not be so for others.

if you are referring to this email even here, it was not explicit. Might have missed it in the gmeet. A mail would have been good.

**Image Description:** This is an email from the TDS team (likely from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, judging by the email address) to students in a course (se2002) regarding project submissions.

**Key Information:**

* **Subject:** The email's subject indicates urgency: "[TDS Jan 2025] Important: Please check your submissions for basic sanity"
* **Sender:** donot_reply@study.iitm.ac.in, suggesting an automated or mass email.
* **Date:** The email was sent on Sun, Feb 16, at 8:18 PM.
* **Recipients:**  25t1_se2002-announce indicates a class mailing list for students.
* **Basic Sanity Checks:**  The email details four basic checks performed on project submissions:
    * Is the GitHub repo public?
    * Does it have an MIT license?
    * Does it have a DockerFile?
    * Is the Docker image accessible?
* **Submission Status:** Out of 530+ submissions, only 284 passed the basic sanity checks.  Emails were sent to the remaining 250+ students with errors.
* **Consequences:** Students whose submissions failed the sanity checks risk receiving 0 marks.  The email notes that the *last* submission was used for grading.
* **Action Required:** Students are urged to check their inbox (including spam) for the error notification and rectify any issues immediately.

In short, this email serves as an urgent notification about project submission issues and urges students to take corrective action to avoid losing marks.  The emphasis is on the basic sanity checks of the submitted projects.

**Image Description:** This image shows an email, seemingly an automated notification regarding a project submission. The email's subject line indicates it's from the course "22t1 se2002," sent at 1:27 am.  The main body informs the recipient ("Dear Learner") that Project 1 requires passing several pre-requisite checks detailed on a "TDS Project 1: Evaluation" page.  These checks include:

1.  A publicly accessible GitHub repository.
2.  The GitHub repository containing a LICENSE file with the MIT license.
3.  A valid Dockerfile in the GitHub repository.
4.  A publicly accessible Docker image runnable via a specific command (using `podman run`).
5.  The Docker image using the same Dockerfile as the GitHub repository.

The email then presents the results of the pre-requisite evaluations:

*   **Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:** PASS
*   **Is Github repo present AND public:** FAIL
*   **Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo:** FAIL
*   **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** FAIL

Consequently, the overall status of the prerequisites is marked as **FAIL**, and the Project 1 score is 0.  The email clearly states that failure to meet the minimum requirements results in the submission not being evaluated.  The email's design suggests an automated system evaluating the submission against pre-defined criteria.

**Image Description:** The image shows a Gmail message on a Windows computer. The message is from "22t1 se2002" to the recipient, a "Dear Learner."  The subject is likely related to a project, "Project 1," as indicated in the email body and in the browser tab.

The email details pre-requisite checks that need to be passed for "Project 1." These checks involve:

1.  A publicly accessible GitHub repository.
2.  The repository containing a LICENSE file with the MIT license.
3.  A valid Dockerfile in the repository.
4.  A publicly accessible Docker image runnable via a specific command involving environment variables (`AIPROXY_TOKEN`, `SAIPROXY_TOKEN`).
5.  The Docker image using the same Dockerfile as the GitHub repository.


The email then presents an evaluation of these prerequisites. The results show that only the Docker image presence and public accessibility on DockerHub passed. The other checks (GitHub repository's public accessibility, presence of a Dockerfile and MIT license in the GitHub repository) all failed. The final score for "Project 1" is 0 due to the failed prerequisites.

The top of the image shows the Google Chrome browser with several tabs open, indicating other activities on the computer.  One tab is titled "Repositories," possibly related to the project's code management.  The time and date in the lower right corner of the screen are visible (14:15, 03-04-2025). The email's timestamp is April 1st, showing a delay in accessing the email.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/9/1/915ae521873c3a286c2e898ddc8d33881ff5969e_2_690x388.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a GitHub repository page for a project named "llm_aa_tds_project".  The page is dark-themed.

**Key Information:**

* **Repository URL:**  The URL in the browser address bar clearly identifies the repository: `https://github.com/23f1001415/llm_aa_tds_project`
* **Project Files:** The left-hand side displays the project's file structure, including folders (`pycache`, `data`) and various Python files (`app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`), a `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, and `README.md`.
* **Commit History:** The central section shows a detailed commit history.  Most commits are labeled "Initial commit with Dockerfile and application code" and were made 2 months ago. One commit is specifically labeled "Create app.py".
* **Repository Statistics:** The right-hand section provides information about the repository, including:
    * **About:**  Currently, there's no description, website, or topics provided for this project.
    * **Activity:** Links to view the repository's activity.
    * **Stars, Watching, Forks:** The repository currently has 0 stars, 1 watcher, and 0 forks.
    * **Releases:** No releases have been published yet. There is a button to create a new release.
    * **Packages:** No packages have been published yet. There is a button to publish the first package.
    * **Languages:**  The repository primarily uses Python (90.4%) with a small percentage of Dockerfile (1.6%).

**Overall:**

The image depicts a relatively new GitHub project that seems to be in its early stages of development. It's likely a Python project using Docker for containerization.  The lack of description and absence of published releases and packages suggests it's still under active development.

**Image Description:** Here's a description of the image content:

The image shows a code-review or version control interface, likely from a platform like GitHub or GitLab.  The top section displays tabs for "Preview," "Code," and "Blame," along with file size information (1069 lines, 127 KB).  There are also several buttons for raw view, download, and editing.

A search bar is visible, containing the email address `23f1000057@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.

Below, a table displays information:

* **Timestamp:** Shows a date and time: `2/16/2025 20:39:53`
* **Email Address:**  Duplicates the email address from the search bar.
* **Two question columns:**  The first asks for the GitHub repository link containing the code for "Project 1," and the second asks for the DockerHub image name.
* **Answer columns:** Provides the answers to the questions. The GitHub repository link is: `https://github.com/Vedant22042004/project`, and the DockerHub image name is `vedant22042004/project`.

The overall context suggests a review or submission of code for a project, possibly part of a larger course or academic assignment.  The email address likely belongs to a student, and the project is hosted on both GitHub and DockerHub.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/1/2/12102c6f548ec1535363f91201441acbc019a484_2_690x336.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a computer screen displaying a Docker Hub "404 Not Found" error. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Browser Address Bar:** The address bar shows the URL `https://hub.docker.com/r/vedant2204/project/tags`, indicating an attempt to access a specific Docker Hub project page belonging to a user named `vedant2204`.

* **Docker Hub Navigation:** The top of the screen displays the Docker Hub interface with standard navigation elements such as "Explore" and "My Hub" buttons, and a search bar.

* **Error Message:** The main part of the screen is dominated by a large, circular, light-blue area containing a 404 error message.  The message clearly states "404 Oops! The page you have requested was not found". A small illustration of a person looking at a computer screen is also included in the circle.

* **Browser Controls:**  The browser window shows typical controls in the top right corner.

The image indicates that the requested Docker Hub page, `/r/vedant2204/project/tags`, could not be found, likely because the page either doesn't exist, or the user lacks permission to access it.

**Image Description:** The image shows a screen capture of a Docker Hub repository page for the image `zakiy7/my-fastapi-app`.  Here's a breakdown of the key information:

* **Repository Name:** `zakiy7/my-fastapi-app`  This is the primary identifier for the Docker image.

* **Owner:** `zakiy7`  The user or organization that owns this repository.

* **Last Updated:** Approximately one month ago.

* **Image Type:** Indicated by the "IMAGE" label, suggesting this is a standard Docker image.

* **Stars and Downloads:** The repository has 0 stars and 26 downloads.

* **Tags:** Currently only the `latest` tag is visible, indicating this is the most recent version of the image.  The "Filter tags" search bar suggests the possibility of additional tags.

* **Last Push:**  The `latest` tag was last pushed about a month ago by `zakiy7`.

* **Digest:** `740fcf3f65bb` This is a unique cryptographic hash that identifies the specific content of the image.

* **OS/Architecture:** `linux/amd64`  Specifies the image is built for a 64-bit Linux system.

* **Last Pull:** The image was last pulled 5 days ago.

* **Compressed Size:** The size of the compressed image is 261.49 MB.

* **Pull Command:** `docker pull zakiy7/my-fastapi-app:latest`  This command can be copied to download the image.  A "Copy" button is present.

* **Manage Repository Button:**  A button to manage settings for the repository is available, suggesting the user likely has administrative privileges.

In summary, the image displays the details of a Docker image hosted on Docker Hub, showing its metadata, usage statistics, and a convenient command to download the latest version. The image name suggests it might be a FastAPI application.

**Image Description:** This image shows a GitHub repository's file view.  The repository's name is `/23f1002643/Ilm-automation-agent`.  The top of the image displays a typical GitHub interface with options for navigation, including the repository name, branch selection ("main", with "1 Branch" indicated), tags ("0 Tags"), search, and adding/viewing code.

The main body of the image shows a list of files within the repository, including:

* `_pycache_` (a directory)
* `Dockerfile`
* `LICENSE`
* `README.md`
* `app.py`
* `datagen.py`
* `evaluate.py`
* `requirements.txt`
* `tasksA.py`
* `tasksB.py`

Next to each file, the most recent commit action is indicated ("Add files via upload" or "Initial commit").  A commit hash (`c883879`) and timestamp ("2 months ago") are displayed for each entry, with a total of 4 commits. The image suggests that the project was recently initialized, with the majority of files added via upload within the last two months.  The `Dockerfile` suggests the project is likely containerized.  The presence of a `requirements.txt` file indicates that it likely uses a virtual environment and package management with `pip`.  The presence of `.py` files indicates that it is likely a Python project.

I recently received an email with an evaluation file for Project 1, which included a score. However, in the recent email, I noticed that my score was recorded as zero, despite fulfilling all the prerequisites.

I kindly request a re-evaluation of my project, as I believe this may be an error.

Sir,

In the mail that i got about project 1 report. In the log file it was written as TasksA.py file not found in docker, which was the case i observed with many students.

This is my Github repo:

I built the image using docker build command in vs code terminal. And pushed it same way to dockerhub using docker push command. How is it possible that the docker container missed the TasksA.py file while building or pushing it?


After getting this mail, I ran the project locally again mutliple times just to check if there was any issues in the code. It was getting 9/10 test cases passed.

### Image Insight:

**Image Description:** The image shows a terminal output, primarily focusing on package installation and a subsequent error.  Here's a breakdown:

* **Successful Package Installation:** The top portion shows a series of messages indicating the building and downloading of various Python packages.  These include: `antiorm`, `db`, `db-sqlite3`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `numpy`, and `pydantic-core`.  The sizes of the downloaded packages are also listed in MiB (Megabytes).  The output confirms successful installation of 33 packages in 56 milliseconds.

* **Error Message:** The bottom section displays a `Traceback` indicating an error.  The crucial part is the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tasksA'`. This means the code in `/app/app.py` on line 22 attempts to import a module named `tasksA`, but that module isn't found in the Python environment. This is the likely root cause of the program's failure.

* **Relevant File Path:** The error message provides the file path `/app/app.py`, line 22, where the error occurs.  This is helpful for debugging.

In summary, the image shows a successful installation of numerous packages, but then reveals a failure due to the inability to import a module named `tasksA`. The error points to a problem with the code itself, likely a misspelling, incorrect path, or a missing module which needs to be installed separately.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/0/c/0ce93452fedd6a15660a312186ed7f3b3a10a39e_2_690x372.png)

**Image Description:** This image shows a GitHub repository page for a project named "tds-project1" owned by user "GaURaVinDeX".  The repository appears to be very new, with all files showing "initial commit" timestamps approximately two months prior.

Here's a breakdown of the key information visible:

* **Repository Overview:** The top shows standard GitHub repository navigation (Code, Issues, Pull requests, etc.). The project name and owner are clearly displayed.  The repository is marked as "Public".

* **File Structure:** The left side shows the files and folders within the repository: `.pycache`, `.gitignore`, `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`, and a `README` (although the README is empty and prompts the user to add content).  This suggests a Python project utilizing Docker.

* **Commit History:** The central section displays the commit history, showing that each file has only one commit, labeled "Initial commit," made two months ago.

* **About Section:** The right side includes the "About" section, which currently has no description, website, or topics provided. It shows the repository is licensed under MIT and has zero stars, one watcher, and zero forks.

* **Releases and Packages:**  The "Releases" and "Packages" sections indicate that neither releases nor packages have been published yet.

* **Languages:** The "Languages" section indicates the primary languages used are Python (98%) and Dockerfile (2%).

* **Suggested Workflows:** This section suggests setting up the project as a Python package.

In short, the image depicts a newly created GitHub repository for a Python project using Docker, ready for further development. The lack of a README and other descriptive information suggests the project is in its very early stages.

This is a common mistake many, many students made. They created a working application but not a working container.


Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 11.13.32 am
2116×1512 323 KB

You only copied 
app.py
 into your docker image.


How do you expect your application to run without the other files that your repo clearly shows is needed?


Thats why many people are failing this. Hope the image makes this clear.


Kind regards

**Image Description:** The image shows a GitHub repository page displaying a `Dockerfile`.  The top section shows standard GitHub navigation elements (Code, Issues, Pull Requests, etc.) and a file explorer on the left, listing various files within the project, including:

* `_pycache_`: A directory likely containing compiled Python bytecode.
* `.gitignore`:  A file specifying files and directories to exclude from version control.
* `Dockerfile`: The file currently being viewed.
* `LICENSE`: The project's license file.
* `app.py`: The main application file (likely a Python script).
* `requirements.txt`:  A file listing project dependencies.
* `tasksA.py` and `tasksB.py`: Additional Python files, possibly containing tasks or scripts.

The main content is the `Dockerfile` itself, which consists of several instructions:

1. **`FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm`**: Specifies the base Docker image to use (a slim version of Python 3.12).

2. **Install Dependencies**:  Uses `apt-get` to update the package list and install `curl` and `ca-certificates`.

3. **Download and Install `uv`**: Downloads and executes a script (`uv-installer.sh`) to install the `uv` library (likely libuv, a cross-platform asynchronous I/O library).

4. **Install FastAPI and Uvicorn**: Uses `pip` to install the FastAPI web framework and Uvicorn ASGI server.

5. **Set PATH**:  Adds the `/root/.local/bin` directory to the PATH environment variable, ensuring the installed `uv` binary is accessible.

6. **Set up Application Directory**: Sets the working directory to `/app`.

7. **Copy Application Files**: Copies the `app.py` file into the `/app` directory.

8. **Explicitly set the correct binary path and use `sh -c`**: This line specifies the exact path to the `uv` executable and how to run the application using `sh -c`. This suggests that the application might need to be run with the `sh` command for some reason.  

A red arrow points to the section where application files are copied into the application directory within the Docker image.  The image provides a complete picture of the Dockerfile's instructions for building a Docker image to run a Python application using FastAPI and Uvicorn. The use of `uv` suggests it may be performance-critical, or used for non-blocking I/O operations.

**Image Description:** This is an email from the "TDS Team" regarding the evaluation of "Project 1".  The email informs the recipient ("Dear Learner") that their project failed to meet the minimum requirements for evaluation.

The email details five prerequisites that were checked:

1. **GitHub Repository Existence and Public Accessibility:** PASSED
2. **MIT License in GitHub Repository:** FAILED.  This is the reason for the overall project failure.
3. **Valid Dockerfile in GitHub Repository:** PASSED
4. **Publicly Accessible and Runnable Docker Image:** PASSED
5. **Docker Image uses the same Dockerfile as the GitHub Repository:** PASSED

The email explicitly states that because the MIT license was not found at the root of the GitHub repository, the prerequisites check failed, resulting in a Project 1 score of 0 and the project not being evaluated.  The email includes a reference to a "TDS Project 1: Evaluation" page for further details about the requirements and also warns the recipient not to reply to this automated email.

**Image Description:** This image shows a screenshot of a GitHub repository page. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible information:

* **Top Bar:** Displays the time (11:06), battery percentage (23%), and a GitHub URL: `github.com/00-Aryan`.  There are standard GitHub icons for home, stars, forks, watchers, branches, tags, and activity.

* **Repository Overview:** Shows repository statistics: 0 stars, 0 forks, 1 watcher, 1 branch, 0 tags.  It's labeled as a "Public repository."

* **File Listing:**  The main section shows a list of files and folders within the repository's `main` branch. Each entry includes a file icon (folder or file), the filename, and the last modified timestamp ("2 months ago" for all listed files/folders).  Files include Python scripts (`app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`), a requirements file (`requirements.txt`), a Dockerfile, a LICENSE file, and a README file. The `_pycache_` folder suggests previous Python execution.

* **Bottom Bar:** Indicates the repository uses the MIT license.

In short, the image provides a snapshot of a publicly accessible GitHub repository belonging to a user named "00-Aryan".  The repository seems to contain code (likely Python) associated with some kind of data generation and evaluation, potentially utilizing Docker.  The files listed are common for data science or machine learning projects.

@thinkmachine


Firstly, you have passed evaluation and got a decent score (on a more lenient script that we used for everyone.) The email was sent by a script that used a more stricter evaluation (which understandably caused some stress). So you can breathe a sigh of relief. 


However
 with regards to your long post…


Let me tell you a true story. I personally know a 
very
 experienced senior engineer at a top defense contractor for the US, here is some pearls of wisdom from him.


What you have done is what is called in industry as 
gold plating
. Its a cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec.


In fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why?




Because it does not deliver what was required,


Wastes valuable time and resources


Increases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!)


Complicates testing


Leads to scope creep




His advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate.


I hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out.


For personal hobbies this does not apply. But for a client (including us) if you fail to deliver the minimum spec then we cannot grant you an evaluation (by the way this post is not targetted specifically for you, it just felt like an appropriate place to explain this).


Kindest regards

## Post #286 by Abhay222 (Post ID: 615182)
Hi Sir,

I just realized that I mistakenly submitted the image tag “abhay227/version1” instead of the correct image ID. The correct image ID is 
4db729a03f74
 , which is part of version1 that is already present and publicly available.

I have worked very hard on this project, and I am concerned that due to this error, my whole effort may be wasted. Unfortunately, I did not receive any notification regarding an invalid submission after I submitted the Project1 form, and I only recently became aware of this mistake. I kindly request you please consider this correct image ID.


Thank you for your understanding and assistance. I look forward to your positive response.

**Image Description:** This image shows a screenshot of a Docker Hub repository page for an image tagged "version1".  The key information includes:

* **TAG:** `version1` is the tag of the Docker image.
* **Last pushed:** The image was last pushed about a month ago by a user named `abhay222`.
* **Digest:** The image digest is `4db729a03174`, a unique identifier.
* **OS/ARCH:** The image is built for `linux/amd64` architecture (64-bit Linux).
* **Last pull:** The image was last pulled approximately one month ago.
* **Compressed size:** The compressed size of the image is 261.98 MB.
* **Docker pull command:** A button displays a pre-populated Docker pull command `docker pull abhay227/tds_project:version1` which the user can copy directly to their terminal to download the image.

The overall context suggests this is a record of a specific Docker image within a repository.  The information displayed is standard metadata for managing and tracking Docker images.

Hi Abhay,


This was a basic error. Unfortunately for basic errors we are not able to relax the requirements. All students were given a clear directive on what the minimum requirements were in order to be evaluated. Failure to follow those clear instructions prevents us from making any exceptions, because then we just have to dump all those requirements for all students and that would not be fair to those that took the care to be careful about their submissions.


Kind regards

## Post #289 by thinkmachine (Post ID: 615386)
Thanks for the clarification regarding the evaluation, 
@carlton
. It’s a relief to know that my original submission was successfully evaluated. Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April 1), I would’ve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether.


Regarding your point on gold plating — I completely understand and have come to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience, especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets, maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS projects, my goal was purely exploratory — to explore the boundaries of what’s possible 
within the scope of the problem statement
.


What began as just another (pun intended) 
tedious
 assignment slowly evolved into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents. 


(…caution: long post ahead 
)


I noticed that 
test cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python & Shell use
. While it would’ve been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the 
inherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads
. No two payloads are exactly alike — even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably. There’s also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM.


Some might suggest using 
temperature=0
 to get more deterministic LLM behavior — and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn’t be helpful here as 4o-mini isn’t all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions. There’s only so much stuff it can pay attention to.


Hardcoded tool agents also aren’t really “agents” in my view— they’re more like passive AI powered regex matchers
: merely mapping inputs to functions by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning process. If they break, the agent will never try to ‘fix’ them and keep calling them like a broken record.


At the core of it, it’s all about 
how much flexibility vs rigidity
 we give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between — The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio.


Since most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to,




Reason about the task, understand intent,


Reflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e. 
design
 a DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else)


Execute those workflows (
walk
 the DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed.


Observe the final result, and repeat if needed.




Interestingly, a similar framework was suggested in 
this ICLR 2022 paper
. That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction.


To make environment interaction possible, the agent didn’t need dozens of narrow tools — just a small, well-defined set of 
general-purpose tools
:




A REPL executor (for quick calcs)


A Python script runner


A Shell executor




With just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally — avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more.


As for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of Project 1 (like training & tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results etc.) — that was 
emergent behavior
, not deliberate gold plating. It was a pleasant surprise even to me. I’ve yet to discover more of such interesting hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research. 
Frankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff!


I am actually very thankful to the TDS course team & 
@s.anand
 for devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with. 
Food for thought! Really!


As for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I’ll be experimenting with— modalities.


PS: I’m not claiming it’s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects: 
thoughtful use of LLMs in agent design
. At this point, I’m less concerned about the marks, I’m actually enjoying the thought joyride. 




TL;DR

My approach doesn’t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates — much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I’ve only just wired the pieces together.


Kind regards

**Image Description:** This is an email regarding a failed Project 1 submission.  The email details the requirements for the project, which include:

1.  An accessible GitHub repository.
2.  A LICENSE file in the GitHub repository with an MIT license.
3.  A valid Dockerfile in the GitHub repository.
4.  A publicly accessible Docker image that runs via `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=SAIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 SIMAGE_NAME`.
5.  The Docker image using the same Dockerfile as the GitHub repository.

The email then shows the results of the prerequisite evaluations:

*   **Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:** PASS
*   **Is Github repo present AND public:** FAIL
*   **Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo:** FAIL
*   **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** FAIL

Because of these failures (specifically the missing public GitHub repo, Dockerfile, and MIT license), the **Prerequisites** are listed as **FAIL**, and the **Project 1 Score** is **0**.  The email explicitly states that submissions failing to meet these minimum requirements will not be evaluated.  Finally, the email instructs the recipient not to reply and to contact the course team via Discourse for any further assistance.

**Image Description:** Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a project page, likely from a platform like GitHub. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Project Name and Owner:** At the top, the text "SrishtiySnehi/Project_1_tds" is prominently displayed. This indicates the project's name ("Project_1_tds") and the owner's username ("SrishtiySnehi").

* **Project Icon:** To the right of the project name is a small, square icon.  It's a simple, pixelated design in a muted reddish-pink color, appearing somewhat like an abstract symbol or logo. It doesn't suggest a specific file type or project nature readily.

* **Project Statistics:** Below the name and icon, several statistics are presented:

    * **Contributor:** A person icon followed by the number "1," indicating one contributor to the project.
    * **Issues:** A circle icon with a minus sign inside, showing "0" issues.
    * **Stars:** A star icon followed by "0" stars.
    * **Forks:** A branching icon showing "0" forks.

* **GitHub Logo:** In the bottom right corner, a simplified version of the GitHub logo (a stylized cat) is visible, reinforcing the likelihood that this is a GitHub project page.

* **Background:** The overall background is primarily white, with a dark teal/blue bar at the very bottom of the image.

In summary, the image depicts a relatively new or inactive project named "Project_1_tds" by the user "SrishtiySnehi" on a platform resembling GitHub, with zero issues, stars, and forks reported.  The project has only one contributor.

* **`Running task: Delete /data/format.md`**: This line shows that a task is currently running.  The task is to delete a file located at the path `/data/format.md`.  The yellow circle visually indicates that this task is in progress.

* **`HTTP Request: POST http://localhost:8325/run?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"`**: This is the most informative line.  It details the HTTP request made as part of the delete operation:
    * **`POST`**: The HTTP method used, indicating the request is sending data to the server.
    * **`http://localhost:8325/run`**: The base URL of the server. `localhost` means the server is running on the same machine, and port `8325` is specified. `/run` likely indicates an endpoint for executing tasks.
    * **`?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md`**:  A query parameter that specifies the task to be executed. The task is "Delete" and the path to the file to delete is URL-encoded. `%2F` represents the `/` character in URL encoding.
    * **`"HTTP/1.1 200 OK"`**:  The HTTP response received from the server.  `HTTP/1.1` is the HTTP version. `200 OK` indicates the request was successful.


In summary, the image depicts the successful execution of a delete operation on a file named `format.md` located in the `/data` directory. The operation was performed via an HTTP POST request to a local server. The log provides details of the task, the request made, and the successful response received.

Request for Clarification on Zero Marks Given – Repository Was Public with All Required Files


Dear 
@Carlton
 sir

I wanted to kindly request a clarification regarding the evaluation of my project submission. I noticed that I have been awarded zero marks, and I’m a bit confused because I had made sure that everything was in place.




My GitHub repository was 
public
 at the time of submission.


I had included the 
Dockerfile
 as required.


I also added the 
MIT License
 to the project.


For your reference, I am also attaching a 
snapshot
 of the repository as it was during the submission time.




Given all these were in place, I would really appreciate it if you could provide a 
concrete reason
 for giving 
zero marks
. I’m eager to understand what went wrong so I can avoid it in the future and improve myself. But u saying in email that my repo was not public , not having dockerfile and not having mit licsence .

**Image Description:** This image shows a Gmail inbox view. The main content is an email detailing a scoring system for a project.

**Key information from the email:**

* **Scoring:**  The email explains that the total score is out of 20, normalized from a Project 1 high score of 16. Each completed task is worth 1 mark (or 1.25 after normalization).  Tasks C1-C5 are bonus tasks.  A bonus is also awarded based on the number of commits and repository size (after removing cache and environment files).  A power transform and scaling with weights of 2.5 are applied to these bonus factors.

* **Final Score Calculation:** The final score is the minimum of 20 and the sum of the task score and the bonus.

* **Repository Submissions:**  The email lists the submitted GitHub and Docker repositories using hyperlinks:
    * GitHub: `https://github.com/harrypandey6291/ds_lim_automation-agent`
    * Docker: `hariompandey6388/11-automation-agent2`

* **Prerequisites Check:** A checklist shows whether the prerequisites have been met (1 for pass, 0 for fail):
    * Docker repository exists and is public (before February 18th): 1 (pass)
    * GitHub repository exists and is public (before February 18th): 0 (fail)
    * GitHub repository has a LICENSE or LICENSE.md file (MIT License): 0 (fail)
    * GitHub repository has a Dockerfile: 0 (fail)

* **Task Scores:** A table shows scores for tasks A1-A10 and B1-B10.  All values shown are 0.

**Other Relevant Features:**

* **Gmail Interface:** Standard Gmail elements are visible, such as the compose button, inbox list, starred, snoozed, sent, drafts, and labels sections.  The email count in the inbox is 8,170.
* **Email Header:**  The email header shows the sender ("IT Malna") and indicates this is email 1 of 9,173.

In short, the image shows an email providing a student or developer with their project scores, outlining the scoring criteria, and indicating issues with their GitHub repository setup.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/6/a/6a6a5cdd6a3ef7b88e3a82742621e730b10c68dd_2_690x362.png)

**Image Description:** This image shows a GitHub repository page for a project named "tds_llm_automation-agent".  Here's a breakdown of the key content:

**Repository Information:**

* **Repository Name:** `tds_llm_automation-agent` - This is the project's name.  The "llm" likely suggests it involves large language models.  "Automation-agent" implies it's an automated agent of some kind.
* **Owner:** `harrypandey829` - The username of the GitHub user who owns the repository.
* **License:** MIT License -  Indicates the project uses the permissive MIT open-source license.
* **Status:** The repository appears to be in early stages of development or recently created, with:
    * 3 commits
    * 0 stars
    * 0 forks
    * 1 watching


**Repository Contents (File Structure):**

The left-hand pane lists the files and folders within the repository.  Key files include:

* `_pycache_`: A folder typically containing compiled Python bytecode.
* `env`:  Likely a file or folder related to the project's environment (dependencies).
* `LICENSE`: The project's license file (MIT License).
* `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`:  Python files suggesting different components or modules of the project.  The names imply data generation (`datagen.py`), an application (`app.py`), evaluation (`evaluate.py`), and separate task modules (`tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`).
* `dockerfile`: A file for building a Docker container.  This suggests the project may be designed to run in a containerized environment.
* `README`: A file containing information about the project (likely a description and instructions).

**Other Features:**

* **GitHub Interface:** The image clearly displays the standard GitHub user interface, including tabs for "Code," "Issues," "Pull requests," "Actions," "Projects," "Wiki," "Security," "Insights," and "Settings."
* **About Section:** The "About" section contains the project description: "This is my final effort towards tds project."  This suggests that "tds" might be an abbreviation for a larger project or goal.
* **Languages:**  A progress bar in the "Languages" section suggests that the project is primarily written in Python (100%).


In summary, the image depicts a GitHub repository for a Python-based automation project (likely involving large language models) which is in its early development phase.  The project's files indicate it might involve data generation, evaluation, and multiple tasks, packaged for containerized deployment.  More context on "tds" is needed to fully understand the project's scope.

## Post #303 by Arunvembu (Post ID: 615995)
Hi sir

I noticed a discrepancy in my Project 1 results. In the initial results shared on March 29th, I had received 8/20 based on the evaluation logs. However, the final result I received today states that none of the tasks in Task A and B were working, and I was awarded only 1 bonus mark.


During my own testing, I was consistently getting 7/10 correct in Task A, so I’m a bit confused about the change.

Kindly request you to look into this discrepancy sir

Thank you

## Post #304 by 24ds2000069 (Post ID: 615996)
Dear 
@carlton
 Sir,


I was getting 8 marks in your evaluation but today I checked the mail, I was awarded 0 marks. I am not sure what happened. Everything was in place. I would really appreciate if you can provide a reason for zero marks. I rechecked everything and looks good. Awaiting your reply. Thanks.

**Image Description:** The image shows a snippet of text output, likely from a software test or debugging session.  Here's a breakdown:

* **Top Line:** A red X symbol followed by "B10 FAILED" indicates a failure in a test case labeled "B10".

* **Second Line:** A small icon resembling a dart hitting a target is present, followed by "Score: 8 / 20". This suggests a scoring system where 8 points out of a possible 20 were achieved. The test failed despite achieving a score.

* **Third Line:** "HTTP Request: POST https://aiprc..."  This indicates an HTTP POST request was made to a URL beginning with "https://aiprc...". The full URL is truncated.

In summary, the image shows that a test (B10) failed despite achieving a partial score (8/20). The failure likely stemmed from an HTTP POST request made to a specified URL.  The "..." indicates further details about the URL or other parts of the HTTP request are not visible.

Respected sir,

I have passed all pre-requisites however my file wasn’t evaluated due to port error (127.0.0.1). Please allow me rectify it as it everything else has passed and is in accordance to the guidelines and I had worked really hard for it not to be evaluated only.

Dear 
@carlton
 Sir,

I’ve noticed discrepancies in my Project 1 results. During the tests I ran before submitting, I consistently got about 7/10 in Task A. In the results shared earlier, I was informed that my evaluation log file was missing. Later, a Gform regarding the architecture was sent, which I filled and submitted. Now, the final result I received today, shows that the taskA module is missing and I’ve been given a bonus of 1 mark.

I kindly request you to look into the matter and provide an explanation and solution in this regard.

Thank you.

## Post #310 by Santoshsharma (Post ID: 616038)
Respected Sir,


I hope you’re all doing well. I’m writing regarding my Project 1 evaluation, as I’ve encountered a discrepancy that I’d like some help with.


According to the evaluation email I received, my score was 0 for all the tasks with an additional bonus of 1 (totaling a P1 score of 1). However, when I ran the provided evaluation script before my submission, I got 7 in Phase A. Additionally, after reviewing the Docker logs, evaluation logs, and the p1_evaluation_error_logs (from the linked Google Sheets), I couldn’t find any reference to my roll number.


Could someone please help me investigate this issue? I’d really appreciate any guidance from the evaluation team.


Thank you for your time and assistance!

 i am sure i had cleared 8/10 test cases in part A of the project despite rigrous checking and no error was found my be but still i have been alloted 0 in all the cases , this is no small issue as project holds a significant amount of weightage in the end term

I had spent hours finishing my project and this i am sure my marks are not on par with the desired work i did

Look into this matter as it signifies if i will be able yo pass tds in this term or not.

**Image Description:** The image shows a GitHub 404 error page. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Browser Address Bar:** The address bar at the top displays the URL: `https://github.com/harrypandey829/tds_llm_automation-agent`. This indicates the user was trying to access a specific GitHub repository belonging to a user named "harrypandey829".  The repository name seems to be related to "tds", "llm", and "automation agent," hinting at a project involving large language models and automation.

* **GitHub Branding:**  The top left corner displays the standard GitHub logo and menu icon.

* **404 Error Message:** The main part of the page shows a large "404" in white against a light-blue background that transitions to light beige. Below it, a text box contains the message: "This is not the web page you are looking for."

* **Illustrative Character:** A cartoon character, styled like a GitHub mascot (a cat) dressed in a hooded robe similar to a Jedi robe, is present. This is a standard part of GitHub's playful 404 error pages. The character has large red eyes, suggesting an almost surprised or apologetic expression.

* **Overall:** The page is a visually appealing error message, common across many websites,  that informs the user that the requested page or resource (the specified GitHub repository) is not found. The URL provides context to why the 404 error occurred.

  sir  When I submitted project 1, I was passing part A with 8/10 marks but today it is showing 0 marks on my email, but when I run it just now it is showing 4/10 on my vs code.

Whereas when I download the file from GitHub and run it, it is showing 1/10 now.

**Image Description:** This image shows a screenshot of a code editor, likely VS Code, displaying the results of a coding task.  Let's break down the key elements:

**1. File Explorer (Left Panel):** This shows a file structure, indicating a project named "LLM Automation Agent".  Key files include `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`, and `tasksB.py`, suggesting a Python-based project potentially involving data generation, evaluation, and tasks (A and B).  There's also a `data` folder, implying data files used by the project.

**2. Code Editor (Center Panel):** The central part displays the code of `app.py`, which seems to be a Python script defining dependencies (requests, fastapi, uvicorn, python-dateutil, pandas) needed for its operation.

**3. Terminal Output (Bottom Center):** This section is crucial for understanding the task's outcome.

* **Task Description:** A message indicates an "A10 Task," which involves querying a SQLite database file (`/data/ticket-sales.db`) containing ticket sales data. The goal is to calculate the total sales of "Gold" tickets.
* **HTTP Request:** The code successfully made an HTTP GET request to a local server (localhost:8000) to retrieve data from `/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt`.
* **Expected vs. Actual Result:** The system provides an `EXPECTED` total sales figure of 177250.79, but the `RESULT` was 200401.84.
* **Task Status:**  The task ("A10") is marked as "FAILED" with a score of 1/10. This suggests the code didn't compute the expected value correctly.

**4. Right Panel (partially visible):** This appears to be another code file, though the content is not fully visible.

**In summary:** The image depicts the result of an automated task that failed to accurately calculate total sales from a database. The failure is clearly indicated by the difference between the expected and actual results and the "FAILED" status. The files and folder structure suggest a well-organized project designed to manage and process data.  The code and output strongly imply a Python-based application designed for data analysis and reporting using an HTTP request and an SQLite database.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/3/f/3fe91b246d5e0f0bf26245d8b4d0ab0d074827f5_2_666x500.jpeg)

**Image Description:** The image shows a laptop displaying code and test results within a Python development environment (likely VS Code or similar).  The primary focus is a Python file (`app.py`) that seems to be interacting with a database or file (`ticket-sales-gold.db` or `.txt`) to calculate total sales for "Gold" tickets.


Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

* **Code:** The `app.py` file contains Python code using the `FastAPI` framework.  It imports various modules for handling HTTP requests and responses, including error handling (`HTTPException`).  There are comments explaining the task's objective: to calculate the total sales of "Gold" tickets from a database or text file.

* **Test Results:**  Below the code, there is output showing an HTTP request made to a local server (localhost:8000) to retrieve data from `ticket-sales-gold.txt`. The `EXPECTED` value (177250.79) and the `RESULT` (200401.84) are shown. The test failed (`A10 FAILED`).  The score is 4/10.  This suggests an automated test is run as part of the development process.

* **File Structure (Left Panel):**  The left panel shows a file explorer view, revealing a project structure with files like `app.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasks.py`, `dockerfile`, `datagen.py`, and `LICENSE`.  This indicates a structured project, possibly involving data generation (`datagen.py`), evaluation (`evaluate.py`), and task management (`tasks.py`).

* **Bottom Panel (Taskbar):** The taskbar shows standard Windows icons and Python-related elements.  The time is visible.


In summary, the image depicts a programmer working on a Python project that involves data processing, likely for a task related to ticket sales analysis. The test results show a discrepancy between expected and actual values, indicating a bug or inaccuracy in the code that needs debugging.

Pass the required arguments to the above application and it will find the latest commit before the 18th, fetch it and unzip it to the folder you specified. Please use the appropriate arguments as specified in the application.


docker build -t <your image name>   .


Run new docker image using


docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 <your image name>


Keep datagen.py and evaluate.py in same folder


uv run evaluate.py --email <any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000


This then re-produces the exact environment how your application was  tested.

You have to provide a token from your environment for testing.

The first is a GET request to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/c5.txt`, which resulted in a 404 error ("NOT FOUND") and a subsequent failure to read `/data/c5.txt`. The second is a POST request to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`, which successfully returned a 200 OK status code.  There's also a "Score: 11 / 25" which seems to indicate a partial success of some task.  The code also includes the username `@singh-yash129` suggesting a user context.

**Pop-up Message:** A pop-up box displays the question: "Do you want to install the recommended 'Python' extension from Microsoft for the Python language?". It offers two buttons: "Install" and "Show Recommendations".

**Other Details:**

* The terminal indicates the line number (61), column (4), spaces, and encoding (UTF-8) information.
* It shows the language is Python and a message indicating "Chat limit reached".
* The taskbar shows several applications are open, including VS Code (the most likely application given the code), Teams, Outlook, and others.  The clock shows the time is 18:27:52 on 06-04-2025.

In short, the image depicts a debugging or development process where a Python developer encountered an error when trying to read a local file, but successfully sent a request to an external API. A recommendation to install a Python extension is also present.

    To replicate the test environment: 
git clone <your repo url> 
cd <your repo directory> 
docker build -t <your image name> 
Run new docker image using 
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -P 8000:8000 <your image name> 
Keep datagen.py and evaluate.py in same folder 
uv run evaluate.py --email=<any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

## Post #330 by 23f2003751 (Post ID: 616101)
Things i have done for my project to work locally:








 carlton:




git clone <your repo url>






cloned my repo which looked like this after cloning(ignore those green dots)


image
274×118 2.87 KB


All the files are  in this folder (I wasn’t aware that we cannot have the subfolder in the root directory,I shouldn’t get penalized for this) and added the datagen and evaluate.py file.








 carlton:




Keep datagen.py and evaluate.py in same folder






when i do this( 
) i get this error








 carlton:




docker build -t <your image name>






PS D:\TDS_Project_1\tds-project-1> docker build -t "tushar2k5/tds-project-1"                                                                 
ERROR: "docker buildx build" requires exactly 1 argument.
See 'docker buildx build --help'.

Usage:  docker buildx build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | -

Start a build



Instead,in order to run the docker image successfully  we have to do either of the two things(taken help from chatgpt 
):

1)


Use full path (recommended if you're outside the project folder):

docker build -t tushar2k5/tds-project-1 D:\TDS_Project_1\tds-project-1



OR

2)


Add a dot (.) at the end to specify the current directory as the build context:

docker build -t tushar2k5/tds-project-1 .



Both the things work for me
(
)








 carlton:




docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -P 8000:8000 <your image name>






docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=i.am.still.noob.inTDS -p 8000:8000 tushar2k5/tds-project-1



Done this(can’t leak my token,already many students stolen it from my project-2🤦‍♂️)








 carlton:




uv run evaluate.py --email=<any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000






uv run evaluate.py --email=23f2003751@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000 



Done this to evaluate my project

**Image Description:** The image shows a section of a file explorer or IDE (Integrated Development Environment), likely within a program like Visual Studio Code. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Bar:** This displays "TDS_PROJECT_1" (likely the project name). To the right are several icons: a file icon (suggesting creating a new file), a folder icon (for creating a new folder), a circular arrow (possibly for refresh or reload), and a duplicate icon (to copy).

* **File/Folder List:** Below the top bar, the list shows:

    * `tds-project-1`: This is a collapsed folder; the arrow indicates it can be expanded to show its contents. The text's green color likely suggests it's a recognized directory or project.
    * `LICENSE`: This is a file. The small golden padlock icon before it indicates this is a file related to licensing or legal information.

* **Status Indicator:** A small, dark teal-colored circle is visible on the far right, often used to show the status of a process or project (e.g., running, stopped, or a build status).

The overall appearance indicates a software development context, where a project named "TDS_PROJECT_1" contains a subfolder of the same name (but lowercase) and a LICENSE file.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/c/fc6fad6517b25106749f3c9c504cf38cc72bed3c.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a code editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment), likely used for programming or software development.  The interface displays several sections: Problems, Output, Terminal, Ports, Comments, and Debug Console. The focus is on the Terminal section.


The terminal shows the following key information:

* **A running task:** The primary task is to determine whether the statement "I hate you" has a positive or negative connotation.  The program is instructed to respond with either "POSITIVE" or "NEGATIVE" (in uppercase) and save the result to a file named `/data/c5.txt`.

* **Task Failure:** The task (labeled C5) failed because the server disconnected without providing a response. This is indicated by a red circle with a "C5 failed:" message and a separate "X C5 FAILED" line.

* **Current Score:** A score of "6/25" suggests that this is part of a larger test or series of tasks, and only 6 out of 25 have been successfully completed.

* **HTTP Request:**  The terminal also displays the details of an HTTP POST request sent to an API endpoint: `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`. The server responded with "HTTP/1.1 200 OK", indicating a successful connection to the server *before* the failure related to the main task.

In short, the image depicts a coding environment where an automated task to analyze sentiment failed due to a server-side issue.  The partially completed task, along with the server response status, are visible in the Terminal output.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/5/55f769f57bb4a5678a20b414877b8f2dee2d7e5d.png)

**Image Description:** The image contains a list of pre-requisites checks, each with a pass/fail status indicated by a 1 or 0 respectively.  The checks are related to Docker and GitHub repositories.

Specifically:

* **Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1** - This check passed.  The Docker repository exists, is public, and was created before February 18th.

* **Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1** - This check also passed. The GitHub repository exists, is public, and was created before February 18th.

* **Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1** - This check passed.  A license file (either `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md`) exists in the GitHub repository, and it's an MIT License.

* **Github repo check - Dockerfile exists: 0** - This check failed. A `Dockerfile` does not exist in the GitHub repository.


The overall result suggests some success, but there's a missing `Dockerfile` preventing the process from completing successfully.  The date "18th of Feb" is likely a deadline or cutoff point for the repositories' creation.

**Image Description:** The image shows a log file, likely from a software testing or evaluation process.  The log displays a series of HTTP requests and their results, along with task descriptions and overall scores.

**Key Features:**

* **Log File Header:**  The top line indicates the log file name: `23f1002223@ds.study.iitm.ac.in_evaluation.log`. This suggests a university or research setting.

* **Tasks and Results:** The log details two main tasks (B9 and B10):
    * **Task B9:** Involved converting a GitHub URL to an HTML file.  It initially succeeded (HTTP 200), but a subsequent GET request failed (HTTP error, "Cannot read"). This failure is marked with a red dot and "FAILED" in red.
    * **Task B10:**  This task aimed to count rows in a CSV file using a datasette server.  It resulted in an HTTP 400 "Bad Request" error due to a connection failure ("Failed to establish a new connection").  This is also indicated with a red dot and a "FAILED" marking.

* **HTTP Requests:** The log meticulously records all HTTP requests, including their type (POST or GET), URL, and any relevant parameters or data sent in the request body.  The URLs frequently point to `localhost`, suggesting local server interactions, and a specific port (8301).

* **Error Messages:**  The log provides detailed error messages for failed requests, helping in debugging. For example, the HTTP 400 error provides information about the database connection issue.

* **Final Score:** The log shows a final score of "7 / 20," suggesting that only a portion of the tests were successful.

* **Sidebar:** A sidebar shows typical email client interface elements (Inbox, Starred, Sent, etc.), suggesting that the log might be viewed within an email client or a similar application.

In summary, the image documents a series of automated tests, likely part of a larger software evaluation or testing pipeline. The failures in tasks B9 and B10 point to potential issues with file access and database connectivity that need further investigation.

**Image Description:** The image shows a terminal window displaying the results of several HTTP requests and some error messages.  Here's a breakdown of the content:


* **HTTP Request 1 (GET):**  This request attempted to GET the file `/data/c5.txt` from the local server `http://localhost:8000/read`. The result was an HTTP 404 error ("Not Found"), indicating the file does not exist at that location.  This is further confirmed by the "C5 failed: Cannot read /data/c5.txt" error message. A red circle with a 'X' emphasizes this failure.  A separate line shows 'C5 FAILED', possibly indicating a module or function named "C5" has encountered a failure.


* **Score:** A score of "7/25" is displayed, possibly indicating progress or success rate in some task or test. A target icon is next to it.


* **HTTP Request 2 (POST):** This request uses the POST method to send data to the API endpoint `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`. This request succeeded, receiving an HTTP 200 OK response. This suggests it successfully sent data to the OpenAI embeddings API.


* **Command Prompt:** The line `PS C:\Users\choud\OneDrive\Desktop\tds1\TDS_Project_1>` shows the current working directory in the PowerShell console. The user is working within a folder named "TDS_Project_1" on their OneDrive.

In short, the image depicts a debugging session where a file read operation failed but an API call to OpenAI succeeded.  The score suggests this is part of a larger process. The context suggests this might be a project involving natural language processing or machine learning, given the OpenAI API usage.

## Post #337 by 23f2002600 (Post ID: 616129)
Please do consider allowing us to change the position of the dockerfile to the root. We are doing nothing but changing its location in the repo. This was not mentioned anywhere in the prerequisites before the submission and it is unfair to not consider all our work for a criteria that was nowhere mentioned in the course page before the submissions. It may be standard practice but a lot of us were unaware. Please do consider this request.

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a web browser displaying a "404 Not Found" error page on Docker Hub. 


Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Browser Address Bar:** The address bar shows the URL: `https://hub.docker.com/r/abhay227/version1/tags`. This indicates the user was attempting to access tags related to a Docker image with the name "version1" from user "abhay227".

* **Docker Hub Navigation:** The top of the page shows standard Docker Hub navigation elements, including a search bar, "Sign in," and "Sign up" buttons.

* **Error Message:** The main content of the screen is a large, circular, blue area containing the error message: "404 Oops! The page you have requested was not found". A small cartoon image of a person looking concerned at a computer screen is also included below the text.

* **Breadcrumb Trail:** Below the Docker Hub navigation, a breadcrumb trail shows the path to the requested resource:  `Explore / abhay227 / version1`

In short, the image documents a failed attempt to access a specific Docker image's tags on Docker Hub.  The error suggests the requested page or resource does not exist.

**Image Description:** This image shows a snippet from a Docker Hub repository page.  The main information displayed is about a specific Docker image tagged as "version1".

Here's a breakdown of the key details:

* **TAG:**  Indicates the image tag is `version1`.  This is a user-defined label for a specific version of the image.

* **Last pushed:** Shows the image was last updated about a month ago by a user named `abhay227`.

* **Digest:**  `4db729a03174` is a unique cryptographic hash of the image's contents. This ensures integrity and allows for verification that the downloaded image matches what's in the repository.

* **OS/ARCH:** Specifies that the image is built for `linux/amd64` architecture (64-bit Linux).

* **Last pull:** Shows when the image was last downloaded. It was about a month ago.

* **Compressed size:** The size of the compressed image is `261.98 MB`.

* **`docker pull abhay227/tds_project:version1`:** This is a command that can be copied (via the "Copy" button) to download the image using the Docker CLI. This command specifies the repository (`abhay227/tds_project`) and tag (`version1`).

In summary, the image provides metadata about a Docker image, including its version, build architecture, size, and last update information.  The command to pull the image is also prominently featured.

**Image Description:** The image shows a section of a web interface, possibly a code review or version control system.  The top shows tabs labeled "Preview," "Code," "Blame," and some file size information ("1069 lines (1069 loc) 127 KB").  There's a search bar at the top containing the email address `23f1001120@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.

Below the search bar is a table with columns for "#", "Timestamp", "Email Address," "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 1?", and "What is the name of the image published on DockerHub?".

A single row of data is visible:

* **#:** 919

## Post #343 by 23ds2000092 (Post ID: 616141)
Hi, I work in the IT industry. There is no standard like “docker file has to be only in the root folder.”


If at all you are setting a requirement why was this not mentioned in the project page?


We were asked to build an app which solves the given tasks. You were OK for whatever code/tools/method to use as long as it works, there the “industry standard” didn’t show up ironically!!!


Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in.


In the same industry that I work - we build the dockers and give it for prod push.

@carlton
 
@Jivraj

Dear Sir,

I got log with error as /bin/sh: 1: [/root/.local/bin/uv,: not found.

I debugged that I had a small issue in the dockerfile that was submitted and it is

CMD [“/root/.local/bin/uv”, “run”, “app.py”]  has an 
invisible Unicode non-breaking space
 (
U+00A0
) between 
"run", "app.py"
 instead of a regular space. This causes the shell to misread the command.

I know it’s very late for the submission to reconsider, but this small mistake spoiled my hard earned project which got local score 8/25 which could finally get converted to 12 marks. I made this change and pushed it to docker and github repository. Considering this, I request you to please evaluate my submission if possible, because I don’t want to lose the marks which i tried my level best to score. I already have good score in GA’s and ROE.  Expecting a positive response from your end.

**Image Description:** The image shows a log file, likely from a software testing or debugging process.  The file displays a series of HTTP requests and their results.  Each entry includes a timestamp (partially visible at the top), a task description, the HTTP request itself (including URL and method), the response code (e.g., 200 OK, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found), and a status indicator (green for success, red for failure).  Several tasks failed, primarily due to "404 Not Found" errors (file not found) and "Connection refused" errors, suggesting network or server issues.

Key features include:

* **Status Indicators:** Green circles indicate successful tasks, while red crosses indicate failed tasks.
* **HTTP Request Details:**  Each entry shows the HTTP method (GET or POST), URL, and parameters of the request.  URLs frequently point to local server addresses (localhost) and external resources (githubusercontent.com).
* **Response Codes:**  HTTP status codes (e.g., 200, 400, 404) indicate the server's response to the requests.
* **Error Messages:** Detailed error messages provide insights into the reasons for failures, such as file not found or connection problems.
* **Task Descriptions:**  Each task is briefly described, for instance, "Convert ... and save it to ...", "Run datasette via ...".
* **Score:** At the bottom, a score of "8 / 20" suggests a test or process with a total of 20 tasks, where 8 succeeded and 12 failed.

The log suggests that a process attempted to access several files and interact with a local server and potentially other servers. Many of the attempts failed due to connectivity problems and missing files. The log is useful for debugging and identifying the causes of these failures.

## Post #346 by Abhay222 (Post ID: 616151)
Sir, I realized that I mistakenly submitted the image tag 
"abhay227/version1"
 instead of the correct image ID. The correct image ID is 
4db729a03f74
, which is part of version1 and is already present and publicly available.

Unfortunately, I didn’t receive any notification about this issue after submission. Receiving this mail at this stage feels disheartening after all the effort I’ve put into the project.  I kindly request you please consider this correct image ID.

**Image Description:** The image contains a pre-requisites check list, formatted as a series of lines with descriptions and a numerical result (1 or 0).  The checks appear to be related to setting up a project using Docker and Github.

Here's a breakdown:

* **`Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)`**: This header explains the meaning of the numerical values (1 indicates success, 0 indicates failure).

* **`Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1`**: This line checks if a Docker repository exists, is public, and was created before February 18th.  The `1` indicates that this check passed.

* **`Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1`**: Similar to the previous line, this checks for a public Github repository created before February 18th.  The `1` indicates a successful check.

* **`Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1`**: This line verifies that either a `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md` file exists in the Github repository, indicating adherence to the MIT License. The `1` signifies success.

* **`Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists: 1`**: This confirms the presence of a `Dockerfile` within the Github repository.  The `1` shows that this check passed.  Note the slight typo in "Github" in this line ("Gihub").


In summary, all the pre-requisite checks have passed successfully (indicated by the '1' after each item).  The checks focus on the existence and accessibility of Docker and Github repositories, along with necessary files (LICENSE and Dockerfile).  The date constraint (before February 18th) suggests a deadline or a version control requirement.

### Image Insight:
![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/6/9/695ad6dd9f35a4590a41863def948b9903941388_2_690x282.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a Google Sheet displaying error logs.  The sheet is titled "p1_evaluation_error_logs" in the top left corner. The sheet appears to be logging errors from various applications, likely during a testing or evaluation phase.


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Spreadsheet Data:** The majority of the sheet contains rows of data. Each row appears to represent a single error log entry.  The columns include:
    * **Column A:** A timestamp (e.g., `2311000049`) possibly combined with an email address (e.g., `@ds.study.itm.ac.in`). This suggests a unique identifier for each log entry.
    * **Column B:**  A description of where the error occurred, possibly indicating a specific application or module (e.g., `taskA module missing`, `application running on 5000 port`, `flask module missing`).
* **Header Row:**  The first row contains the column headers, providing context for the data below.
* **Top Bar:** A standard Google Sheets interface is visible at the top, showing file operations, editing tools, and a "View only" mode is selected.
* **Pagination:**  At the bottom-right of the sheet, there is a pagination indicator (`0 of 0`), which is unusual since there is clearly data in the sheet.  This might indicate a display or loading issue.
* **Error Messages:** Many of the error messages refer to "module missing" errors, indicating missing dependencies or incorrectly configured software. One significant error message points out a Docker container port configuration problem (`Container was bound to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0...`).
* **File Name:** The file is named "p1_evaluation_error_logs". "p1" likely represents a project or phase identifier.

In summary, the image presents a log of software errors encountered during an evaluation of an application or system labeled "p1". The most frequent error type is "module missing", and a critical networking configuration error related to Docker is also present.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/a/e/ae524c05420e98ff1b2b00c89337a31ec8a34a7e_2_690x236.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a file explorer window, likely on a Windows system.  The main focus is a search within the "Downloads" folder.

Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Search Bar:**  The search bar at the top right prominently displays "231001524" as the search term.  This suggests a search is being performed for a file or folder containing this number.

* **Search Results:**  The main window below shows the search results. The message "No items match your search" indicates that no files or folders containing "231001524" were found within the Downloads folder.

* **File Path:** The address bar at the top shows the current location as `Downloads > docker_logs.zip`.  This suggests that a file named `docker_logs.zip` was initially present, but it either doesn't contain "231001524" or is no longer in that directory.

* **File Explorer Navigation:** On the left, a standard file explorer sidebar is visible, showing the typical folders like "Home," "Documents," "Pictures," "Music," etc. This context indicates a user's file system structure.

* **File Information:** Above the search results, various file information columns are visible (Compressed size, Password p., Size, Ratio, Date modified), typical of file explorer views that display properties of files and folders.


In summary, the image shows a user attempting to locate a file within their Downloads folder, likely named `docker_logs.zip` , using the numerical identifier "231001524". The search yields no results.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/0/a/0adbce8db00985ca07a8ad9347c9cb9559139dda_2_690x240.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a file explorer window, likely from a Windows operating system. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Title Bar:** The title bar displays "2311001524 - evaluation_logs.zip", indicating the current directory is the "Downloads" folder and the focus is on a file named "evaluation_logs.zip".  The number "2311001524" might be a user ID or a project identifier.

* **File Explorer Navigation:** The left pane shows a standard file explorer tree view.  Folders visible include "Home," "Gallery," "OneDrive - Persc," "Desktop," "Downloads" (currently selected), "Documents," "Pictures," "Music," "Videos," "BcDs," and "itn."  The "Downloads" folder is highlighted, confirming the current location.

* **File Listing (Main Pane):** The right pane is the main file listing area. A message "No items match your search" is prominently displayed. This means either there are no files in the current "Downloads" folder besides "evaluation_logs.zip"  or that a search was conducted with no results. The columns (Name, Type, Compressed size, Password p., Size, Ratio, Date modified) indicate standard details for files, particularly compressed files like a .zip.  "Password p." likely means "Password protected."

* **Toolbar:** The top toolbar contains standard file explorer controls (back, forward buttons, refresh, new folder, etc.). There is also an "Extract all" button, suggesting the highlighted "evaluation_logs.zip" file is a compressed archive.


In summary, the image shows a file explorer window displaying a "Downloads" folder, where a .zip file named "evaluation_logs.zip" is present, but a search within that folder returned no results (possibly because the search is not relevant to the files present, or the zip file doesn't have any other files).  The numerical ID in the title may be relevant to the context of the file's origin or project.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/e/f/ef7afffc65533ff5136a0ae3532470957d66bb1b_2_690x386.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows an email, specifically what looks like an automated grading report for a programming assignment. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Header:** The top shows typical email controls (reply, forward, etc.), a page number indicator ("2 of 4,356"), suggesting this is part of a larger batch of emails.

* **Score Calculation:** The email begins by explaining the final score is the minimum of 20 or the sum of the task score and bonus points.

* **Repositories:**  It then displays the submitted GitHub and Docker repositories' URLs.  The GitHub repo is clearly linked, while the Docker repo is presented as a plain text string.

* **Pre-requisites Check:** A section details the pre-requisite checks, each with a pass/fail (1/0) status.  All checks passed in this instance (all show a '1'). These checks include verifying the existence and public accessibility of both the Github and Docker repositories, and the presence of licensing and Dockerfile information.

* **Grading Table:** A large table follows, organized into rows (A, B, C) and columns (1-10). All cells in this table contain '0'.  This likely represents individual test cases or assessment criteria, all of which failed.

* **Final Scores:** The email concludes by reporting the task score, bonus, and final P1 score. Note that despite the pre-requisite checks passing, all task scores are '0', but there is a bonus point awarded, and a P1 score of '1'.

* **Log Files:** Finally, there's an explanation that Docker logs are attached for everyone who passed pre-requisites.  Evaluation logs are only attached if the API service started within 5 minutes.

**In summary:** The email shows that while the student fulfilled all the project submission prerequisites, the core functionality of their project (reflected in the '0' values in the large table) did not meet expectations within the time limit.  They still received a bonus point (possibly for submission), which resulted in a total P1 score of 1.

@carlton
 and 
@Jivraj
 , for Task A i had tested before and all the test cases passed, but all my A tasks has failed with 0, In the evaluation logs, i could see that all task A tests failed due to datagen.py not available.


Could you rerun the test ?

---

## Post #350 by Santoshsharma (Post ID: 616168)
Respected Sir,


Thank you for your response and for providing the steps to replicate the test environment.

Steps Taken to Replicate the Test Environment

I cloned my repository using:


bash
git clone <my_repo_url>
cd <my_repo_directory>
I built the Docker image using:

bash
docker build -t.
I ran the Docker container with:

bash
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000

I ensured that datagen.py and evaluate.py were placed in the same folder as instructed.

Finally, I ran the evaluation script using:

bash
uvicorn evaluate.py --email=<any_email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000



Issue with Original Submission

After reviewing the evaluation logs, I identified that the issue with my original submission was caused by binary incompatibility between pandas (version 2.0.3) and NumPy (version 1.24.3). These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally.


However, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail.

I acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message.


Action Taken

To address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected:


The application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes.


It responds to requests within the required timeframe.


I have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository:

Docker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest


Request for Re-Evaluation

I kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly.


Previous Message for Reference

For your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail:


"Greetings, Sir,


I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.


To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.


I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.


Thank you for your assistance!"

There are no evaluation logs for you, I am not sure which evaluation log you are referring to. Your docker image fails to run the required task because your Dockerfile is misconfigured. Did you follow the test environment setup mentioned in this post before posting your query?

    To replicate the test environment: 
Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that 
import requests
import pandas 
DEADLINE = pd.Timestamp("2025-02-18", tz="Asia/Kolkata")

url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits"
try : 
    response = requests.get(url,headers=github_headers, timeout=60)
    fetch_commit = None
    if response.status_code == 200:
        commits = response.json()
        for commit in commits:
            sha = commit["sha"]
   …
  




Because if you did, you will realise why your evaluation failed.

You must replicate the test environment and then if you submission works, you have a legitimate appeal. Otherwise we will not consider it. Please replicate the issue using the test environment as detailed in the post link.


Kind regards

## Post #354 by carlton (Post ID: 616195)
You can take it up with 
@s.anand

I did not come up with the standard.

And it is a standard practise to have build configurations at root of a project otherwise no one will know where to search for the configuration files.




Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in.




Its not difficult to code to search for it, we are not idiots. It was one of the adjustments we considered and asked Anand if we could make the allowance. He made the decision to enforce this protocol.


Kindest regards.

Respected Sir,

see the above image its from the scores we got from mail just before the latest one, in that I had got 7/20 and now new mail shows I got 0?? how is this possible…

the link for evaluation in which i got 7/20 is : 
23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in_evaluation.log - Google Drive


image
1315×732 45.7 KB

MOST importantly mail shows :


Your final t score
 calculation is based on


MIN (20, (task score + bonus))


Github repo submitted:
 
GitHub - 23f2001390/llmagent


Docker repo submitted:
 23f2001390/llmagent


Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)


Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1


Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1


Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1


Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists: 1

Your task score is: 0

Your bonus is: 1

Your P1 score is: 1




So according to the above, I passed the pre-requisites and also in mail u have mentioned that:

We have attached the docker logs and the evaluation logs for everyone who passed the pre-requisites.


but I don’t find my mail id or roll number in the docker_logs.zip or evaluation_logs.zip  that has been given in the mail(latest), if I passed the pre requisites my logs should be there in the zip files included in this latest mail right, my roll number is 23f2001390 and email id is 23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

and nor do i find my id in the p1_evaluation_error_logs so please help sir

Thank you

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/2/f/2fa3b5ca794441978a80d9d1c4e4c850eb67304c_2_690x348.png)

**Image Description:** This image shows a screenshot of a log file, likely from a software testing or debugging process.  The log displays a series of HTTP requests and their results, along with descriptive text explaining the actions performed.

**Key Features and Text:**

* **File Name:** The top-left corner shows the file name "23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in_evaluation.log", suggesting an evaluation or testing log.

* **HTTP Requests and Responses:** The majority of the content consists of entries detailing HTTP requests (GET and POST) made to various URLs.  Each entry includes:
    * The request type (GET or POST)
    * The target URL
    * The HTTP response code (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, 200 OK)
    * Error messages, if any (e.g., "Cannot read /data/b9.html," "Max retries exceeded," "Connection refused")

* **Specific Tasks:** The log entries describe a task involving running a datasette server, querying a database ("ticket-sales.db"), and counting rows based on conditions (where 'type' is "Bronze"). The results of this query are meant to be saved as a CSV file.

* **Error Codes and Messages:**  Multiple entries show HTTP errors, notably 400 Bad Requests and 404 Not Found, indicating problems accessing files or communicating with the server.  Detailed error messages provide insights into the nature of these failures.  For example, the 400 Bad Request includes a "Connection refused" error, pointing to a network connectivity issue.

* **Score:** There is a "Score: 7 / 20" indicating a success rate of 35%.  This implies an automated testing or evaluation framework.

* **URLs:** The URLs used in the requests offer clues to the system's structure:  local server addresses ("localhost:8001," "localhost:8369") and a remote API endpoint ("https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings").

In short, the image documents a series of automated attempts to access data, process it, and send it to another service. The failures suggest that there are problems with either the data access, server availability, or the network connection.  The final "200 OK" result suggests one part of the process succeeded, while many others failed.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/a/f/afbded56c295f1e2ff28878559e430ba3ed8244e_2_690x384.png)

**Image Description:** The image contains the results of an automated evaluation of a submitted project. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Section:** This section displays the Github and Docker repository URLs submitted for evaluation (https://github.com/23f2001390/lmagent and 2312001390/lImagent, respectively).  Note the slight variation in capitalization in the Docker repo name.

* **Pre-requisites Check:** This section shows a checklist of pre-requisite conditions that must be met for successful submission. Each condition is evaluated with a binary outcome (1 for pass, 0 for fail).  All four checks passed (result of 1). The conditions relate to the existence and accessibility of the repositories, the presence of a LICENSE file (indicating MIT license usage), and the presence of a Dockerfile. Timestamps before February 18th are also mentioned, indicating a deadline.

* **Evaluation Matrix:** A table (A1-A10, B1-B10, C1-C5) presents further evaluation results. Each cell appears to contain a score of 0.  The purpose and context of these scores (A, B, C sections) aren't fully explained in the image, but they likely represent different aspects of the project's performance.


* **Summary Scores:** At the bottom, three scores are presented:
    * **Task score:** 0
    * **Bonus:** 1
    * **P1 score:** 1

These scores suggest the main task wasn't successful, but bonus and P1 objectives were achieved.


* **Log Information:** The final paragraph explains that docker logs (always provided) and evaluation logs (only provided if the API started within 5 minutes) are attached.

In summary, the image shows an evaluation report likely for a coding assignment or project submission, detailing pre-requisite fulfillment, task completion, and overall scores. The low task score suggests the main functionality of the submitted API failed to start within the 5-minute time limit, despite fulfilling all pre-requisites and achieving bonus and P1 objectives.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/4/1/41513a69b4af93110ad5c7a3717fca9f0fecd63b_2_690x327.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a Windows File Explorer window.  The address bar indicates the user is currently viewing the contents of the `docker_logs.zip` file located in the Downloads folder.  Importantly, a search has been performed (indicated by the search bar containing `23f2001390`), and the result is that "No items match your search."

The window displays standard File Explorer columns: Name, Type, Compressed size, and Password.  The empty space below the headers shows that the `.zip` archive is empty or does not contain any files matching the search criteria of "23f2001390".  A message "Select a file to preview" is displayed on the right-hand side, indicating the preview pane is empty due to no files being selected.

In summary, the image reveals that a search for "23f2001390" within a zip file named `docker_logs.zip` yielded no results.  The zip file appears either empty or does not contain the searched item.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/d/6/d694d88bee053086a294de30c7566ea08dbbf9c0_2_690x336.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a Windows file explorer window displaying the contents of a zip file named "evaluation_logs.zip" located in the "Downloads" folder.  The window shows that the search produced "No items match your search," indicating the archive is either empty or contains files that do not match the search criteria.  The file size is not shown. The top bar shows the file path: "This PC > Downloads > evaluation_logs.zip". A search ID, "23f2001390", is visible in the search bar.  The window also includes standard columns for "Name," "Type," "Compressed size," and a partially visible "Password p...".  The right side prompts "Select a file to preview."  There are navigational arrows ("<" and ">") to move through potentially multiple search results (although none are shown in this case).

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/c/2/c2b0b8d98d14050bb8021568b7a3ac7101c7e4df_2_690x351.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a Google Sheet titled "p1_evaluation_error_logs".  The sheet contains a log of errors, each with an associated email address and error description.  The relevant columns are:

* **email:**  Contains email addresses, seemingly belonging to students or users (e.g., `211000509@dsstudyitm.ac.in`).  The domain suggests a connection to a school or institution.

* **error_reason:** Describes the error encountered.  These errors fall into several categories:

    * **Missing Modules:** Many errors indicate missing Python modules (e.g., `requests module missing`, `taskA module missing`, `flask cors module missing`, `phaseA module missing`). This suggests the errors originate from Python code.

    * **Port Conflicts:**  An error mentions an application running on port 5000, indicating a potential port conflict.

    * **File System Errors:**  One error points to a missing file (`No such file or directory`).

    * **Docker Configuration:** A significant error highlights a Docker container bound to the wrong IP address (`127.0.0.1` instead of `0.0.0.0`), preventing external access to port 8000.  This indicates a problem with the application's deployment environment.

    * **Other System Errors:**  Other entries report issues like syntax errors (`SyntaxError: unmatched T`), and problems with shell scripts.

The sheet shows a large number of entries, indicating a recurring problem during an evaluation or testing process. The timestamp (2312001390) in the top right corner may be part of a filename or related to the generation time of this log.  The "View only" setting in the sheet suggests that the user is not able to edit the content of the sheet.  In summary, the image provides a detailed log of errors encountered during a software development or deployment process, primarily related to missing modules, incorrect configuration, and file system issues.

**Image Description:** The image shows a Google Sheet displaying error logs, likely from a software evaluation process.  The sheet's title is "p1_evaluation_error_logs".

**Content Details:**

* **Column A:** Contains a timestamped email address, seemingly indicating the time and user associated with each error.  The format appears to be `YYMMDDHHMM@ds.study.itm.ac.in`.

* **Column B:**  Lists various error messages.  Recurring issues include:
    * `taskA module missing` (multiple instances)
    *  Issues related to importing specific Python modules (`pydub`, `flask`, `Phase`, `MAIN`, etc.)
    *  `ImportError` errors, suggesting problems with module dependencies or paths.  One specific instance notes an inability to import `logger` from `'app utils logger'`.
    *  `Container was bound to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0` repeatedly indicates a networking problem, where a Docker container's port 8000 is only accessible locally (127.0.0.1 is the loopback address) and not externally.
    *  A `SyntaxError` related to an unterminated string literal.
    *  `pytesseract` module missing indicates a missing Optical Character Recognition library.
    *  A `RuntimeError` concerning Python version incompatibility (3.12.9 is not supported; only versions >3.6, <3.10 are).

* **Top Menu Bar:** Standard Google Sheets menu options are visible (File, Edit, View, etc.).

* **Search and Filtering:** A search bar and a filter at the top right let users search and filter the log data. The filter currently shows "2312001481"  - this could be a unique identifier or timestamp.

* **"View only" Mode:** The sheet is in "View only" mode, suggesting it is shared for read-only access.

**In summary:** The sheet documents numerous errors encountered during a software evaluation, primarily related to missing modules, Python version compatibility, and a Docker container's network configuration. The recurring nature of several errors suggests a systematic issue that needs investigation.

Hi Hari,


Your docker failed to build.


Did you try to replicate the test environment as mentioned in

    To replicate the test environment: 
Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that 
import requests
import pandas 
DEADLINE = pd.Timestamp("2025-02-18", tz="Asia/Kolkata")

url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits"

If you tried you would find that it will not build. Thats why you have no logs.

90 such cases are there where the image could not be built from your repo.


The specific error in your case is:

tried copying requirements.txt which doesn’t exists


Thats why there are no logs.

We cannot allow changes to repos. This is a blanket rule for everyone. No exceptions. Since the only way to get your project to work is to make changes to it, we cannot score you for changes.

Thanks for the response. We can go on endless discussions using “nice words” “professionally” with the number of questions we have. Finally we are at the receiving end as students in this setup.


What’s the take away for everyone? Let’s move on. This isn’t the end.

What I observed is that most of the repositories appear to be copied from a single source. This original repository contains several issues, such as an incorrectly named Dockerfile and missing instructions to copy all necessary data. Unfortunately, many students seem to have uploaded it blindly without reviewing or fixing these problems.

Most common reason for during running docker image was 
taskA module was missing
 which is because a lot of students blindly copied from someone with building and running image, if they would have done that they could have corrected it at early stage.

## Post #369 by Haricharan (Post ID: 616318)
Sir actually my project doesn’t have requirements.txt, instead it installs automatically

when:


uv run app.py
 is run and for docker image it installs while building and I had submitted the docker image with all libraries required(the dockerfile below, in that it installs while building).

my dockerfile from the repo:


FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates

# Download and install uv
ADD https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh /uv-installer.sh
RUN sh /uv-installer.sh && rm /uv-installer.sh

# Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
RUN pip install fastapi uvicorn requests python-dateutil pandas db-sqlite3 scipy pybase64 python-dotenv httpx markdown duckdb faker pillow

# Ensure the installed binary is on the `PATH`
ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Set up the application directory
WORKDIR /app
# Copy application files
COPY *.py /app/
COPY .env /app/

# Explicitly set the correct binary path and use `sh -c`
CMD ["/root/.local/bin/uv", "run", "app.py"]



here u can see it installs using pip install …


here it’s requiring 
.env
 file to be present in the project folder because my project when I was uploading to both git and docker had 
.env
 file for AIPROXY_TOKEN and I uploaded to docker with that 
.env
 file but as git doesn’t allow upload of 
.env
 file I couldn’t upload
.env
 to git


the project will still work after downloading the repository when we upload AIPROXY_TOKEN as environment variable but to again build the docker image for replicating the test environment, my docker image could not be built because
.env
 file doesn’t upload to GIT, so when I downloaded the repository from the above method, it didn’t have the 
.env
 file so it didn’t build so I had to create the 
.env
 file now to create the docker image, and for the dockerimage I had submitted, I built it with the 
.env
 file(it supports both
.env
 file and environment variable one)

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/1/6/16d50a2f5466ad8d9ed068b4af93899fe3295a4e_2_690x380.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a Google Chrome browser window displaying a log file, `23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in_evaluation.log`, which appears to be related to a data processing or analysis task.  The log shows several HTTP requests and their results.  Key features include:

* **Multiple Failed HTTP Requests:**  The log contains multiple entries indicating failed HTTP requests.  For example, "B9 failed: Cannot read /data/b9.html" and "B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv" suggest problems accessing local files (`/data/b9.html` and `/data/b10.csv`).  Another failure points to a connection refused error (`[Errno 111] Connection refused`). This suggests network connectivity or server-side issues.

* **HTTP 400 and 404 Errors:** The log shows HTTP 400 ("Bad Request") and 404 ("Not Found") errors during HTTP POST and GET requests respectively, to `localhost:8369`. This indicates problems with the requests themselves (incorrect parameters, missing resources) or the server's ability to handle them.

* **Datasette Interaction:** The log contains a description of a task involving Datasette, a tool for exploring and sharing data. The task aims to count rows in a database table where the column 'type' equals "Bronze" and save the result.  The task uses a specific URL (`http://localhost:8001/ticket-sales.csv?sql=SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE type=%22Bronze%22`). This suggests that the process attempts to interact with a database (`ticket-sales.db`) running on `localhost:8001`.

* **Successful Request:** There is also one successful HTTP POST request to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings` which returned a 200 OK status code. This suggests that at least one part of the process, likely interacting with an external embedding service, is successful.

* **Score:** A score of "7 / 20" is displayed, implying a test or evaluation process with a scoring system.


In summary, the log file indicates a series of errors during a data processing pipeline which involves local file access, a Datasette database interaction, and an interaction with an embedding service. The primary failure points seem to be network connectivity and server-side issues preventing proper database access and local file reads.  The overall task likely failed because of these issues.

I did not come up with the standard. 
And it is a standard practise to have build configurations at root of a project otherwise no one will know where to search for the configuration files.

Already the course has taken tolls on our mind. Please give partial marks for the correct run of the docker image or please evaluate my latest commit with the requirements.txt. Because of this project I will lose my cgpa and the hardwork that I have done till this term. A small mistake is causing me my full marks and grades. Atleast consider partial marking for the docker image which does the tasks. I have maintained 9+ cgpa in the diploma and I took other subjects which are easy this term like BDM still is really difficult to cope with the subject. Please consider something. atleast give 50% of the marks for each task which my image passes.

Dear Sir,

I understand that this request is coming at a late stage, and I truly apologize for the timing. However, I felt it was important to express how much effort and dedication I have invested in this project and throughout the course. The recent issue has been disheartening for me, especially because the work I submitted was not a blind copy from someone else.


Had it been otherwise, I wouldn’t have had the courage to reach out. I genuinely care about this course and the learning it offers, and I’m proud of the commitment I’ve shown so far.


With utmost respect, I kindly request you to reconsider evaluating my project again, if there’s any possible way to do so. It would mean a lot to me and would really motivate me to keep pushing forward in this subject.

Hi 
@23f1001524
 
@afsalshah
 
@23f1000879
 
@23f1002056


I understand your situation. We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then it would make evaluations meaningless.


We are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure.


A minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working.


Critical failures prevents everything else from working
 and thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact critical failures.


I know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be important going forward in your career.


Kindest regards

I couldn’t find my Docker logs or evaluation logs in the latest result mail, even though I had passed the prerequisites. I also tried reproducing the test environment and scored 9/25 (screenshot attached below).

**Image Description:** The image shows a terminal window displaying the results of two HTTP requests.

**Top Section:**

* **`> TERMINAL`**: This indicates the title of the terminal window.
* **HTTP Request (GET):**  A GET request was made to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/c5.txt`.  The response was an HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error.  This suggests a problem on the server side preventing the successful retrieval of the file `/data/c5.txt`.
* **Error Messages:** Two error messages are displayed related to "C5". One says "C5 failed: Cannot read /data/c5.txt" and the other simply "C5 FAILED".  These seem to indicate that a process or task labeled "C5" failed due to the inability to read the specified file. The red circle and X are visual indicators of failure.

**Bottom Section:**

* **Score:** A score of "9 / 25" is displayed, likely indicating progress or completion of some kind of test or task.
* **HTTP Request (POST):** A POST request was made to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`. This request was successful, as indicated by the response "HTTP/1.1 200 OK".  This suggests that this is likely communicating with an OpenAI embedding service.

**Overall:**

The image demonstrates the results of a test or workflow where one part (C5) failed while another part (POST request) succeeded. The failure appears to be due to a server-side error preventing file access.  The context of "C5" and the purpose of the requests are unknown without further information.

@s.anand

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to humbly request a reconsideration regarding the evaluation of my project submission.


I understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I’m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn’t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night.


I do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students—including myself—it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation.


I sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I’ve worked hard to demonstrate.


I know you all have our best interests in mind, and I’m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties—especially for a single oversight—can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can be considered with empathy.


Thank you for your time and understanding.

I had put in a lot of hard work into the project, and it would mean a lot to me if you could kindly consider evaluating it, even though the deadline has passed and results are out. I completely understand if it’s not possible, but I just wanted to request a chance as this project was very important to me and I genuinely learned a lot from it.

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a code editor, likely VS Code or a similar IDE, displaying a Git clone operation in progress. 


Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **File Explorer (Left):** A file explorer pane lists files and folders within a project named "Ilmagent."  This includes Python files (`app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`), a Dockerfile, a LICENSE file, and a README file.  This suggests a Python-based project with containerization.

* **Top Menu (Top Right):** The "Start" section provides options to create new files, open existing files or folders, clone Git repositories, and connect to remote resources.

* **Recent Projects (Center):** The "Recent" section shows a recently accessed project, "Ilmagent," with a long hexadecimal string which appears to be a commit hash. This indicates recent activity with this project.

* **Terminal (Bottom):** The bottom pane is a terminal showing a Git clone command being executed:  `git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/Ilmagent.git`.  The output indicates that the cloning process is complete, showing stages like enumerating, counting, compressing objects, receiving objects, and resolving deltas.  The progress is shown with percentages, which finished at 100%.  The size of the cloned repository (19.02 KiB) and the transfer rate (1.46 MiB/s) are also shown.

* **Walkthrough Buttons (Top Right):**  Buttons labeled "Learn" (likely tutorials), and two "Get Started" buttons (possibly for different platforms or functions) are visible.  One appears to be linked to GitHub.

In summary, the image depicts a user cloning a GitHub repository named "Ilmagent" containing a Python project. The cloning process is successfully completed.  The screenshot also provides a glimpse into the project's file structure.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/0/e/0e58db81179e18b5c2b4bd7d75bee3f549d8dac0.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a code editor, likely VS Code, displaying a file explorer and a terminal window.

**File Explorer:** On the left, the file explorer shows a directory named "NEW FOLDER (33)" containing a subdirectory "Ilmagent" with several files: `.env`, `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `Dockerfile`, `evaluate.py`, `LICENSE`, `readme.md`, `tasksA.py`, and `tasksB.py`.  This suggests a Python project. The `.env` file is open in the editor's main pane.

**Editor Pane:** The main pane displays the contents of the `.env` file, which contains only one line starting with `AIPROXY_TOKEN=` followed by a long, seemingly encoded string.  This is a typical format for storing API keys or tokens.  The line number 1 is visible next to this line.

**Terminal Window:** The bottom section displays a terminal window showing a `git clone` command being executed. The command successfully clones a repository from `https://github.com/23f2001390/llmagent` into the `NEW FOLDER (33)` directory.  The output shows the progress of the cloning process, including the number of objects enumerated, counted, compressed, received, and deltas resolved.  The process completed successfully.

**In summary:** The screenshot shows a developer cloning a Git repository containing a Python project. The project appears to utilize an API key stored in a `.env` file. The repository's name is `llmagent`, suggesting it may be related to a language model or AI agent.

**Image Description:** The image shows a code editor window displaying the contents of a Python file named `evaluate.py`.  The left side shows a file explorer panel listing several files within a project directory, including  `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `readme.md`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`, and `evaluate.py` itself.  A `.env` file is also present, suggesting environment variables are used. The `Ilmagent` directory appears to be a parent directory of the project.

The `evaluate.py` file's code starts with comments indicating the script's purpose and its required Python version (">=3.13").  It then lists several dependencies including popular Python packages such as `faker`, `httpx`, `lxml`, `numpy`, `pillow`, and `python-dateutil`.

The code imports standard Python modules (`sys`, `hashlib`, `httpx`, `io`, `json`, `logging`, `numpy`, `os`, `random`, `re`, `subprocess`) and specific functions from `dateutil.parser` and a custom module `datagen`.  The import from `datagen` includes several functions related to data generation, suggesting the script utilizes this module to create various kinds of data (markdown, dates, contacts, logs, documents, emails, credit card information, comments, and tickets). Finally, it imports `fromstring` from `lxml.html` and `Image` from `PIL`, indicating usage of XML parsing and image processing capabilities.

Near the end of the shown code, two API keys are defined: `openai_api_key` and `gemini_api_key`, indicating the script potentially interacts with OpenAI and Gemini APIs.  The actual keys are partially obscured, but it's clear they are long strings.

**Image Description:** The image shows a code editor window split into two sections.

The left section is a file explorer showing a directory named `Ilmagent`.  Within `Ilmagent` are several files: `.env`, `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `Dockerfile`, `evaluate.py`, `LICENSE`, `readme.md`, `tasksA.py`, and `tasksB.py`.  The `app.py` file is highlighted, indicating it's the currently open file.  Some files (`datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`) show an "M" next to them, which might indicate a modifier or file type.

The right section displays the content of the `app.py` file.  The code appears to be a Python script, with lines starting with `#` indicating comments.  Lines 3-15 specify a list of dependencies,  including libraries like `requests`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `python-dateutil`, `pandas`, `db-sqlite3`, `scipy`, `pybase64`, `python-dotenv`, `httpx`, `markdown`, and `duckdb`.  Lines 2 and 17 are comments that indicate the start and end of the script section. Line 16 contains a closing bracket `]`, completing the dependency list.

**Image Description:** The image shows a VS Code window displaying the process of building a Docker image. 


Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

* **File Explorer (Left Panel):** This shows a file structure within a folder named "Ilmagent".  Key files include `app.py` (a Python application file), `Dockerfile` (instructions for building the Docker image), and other supporting files like `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, etc.  The presence of these files suggests a machine learning or data science project.

* **Editor (Top Right Panel):**  The `app.py` file is opened.  It's a Python file that appears to list dependencies using a comment (`#dependencies`). These dependencies include libraries like `requests`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pandas`, `scipy`, and others, confirming the data science or machine learning nature.

* **Terminal (Bottom Right Panel):** This is where the Docker build command is executed. The command `docker build -t llm-agent .` is used to build a Docker image named `llm-agent` from a `Dockerfile` located in the current directory. The output shows the build process:  it's downloading base images, installing dependencies (Python and other packages), copying files into the image, and finally creating the image and tagging it. The lines beginning with `CACHED` indicate that Docker is reusing previously built layers for efficiency.  The final lines show the SHA256 hash of the image and its name. The successful build status is shown as `[+] Building 5.95 (15/15) FINISHED`.

* **Status Bar (Bottom):**  This indicates the PowerShell is the shell being used, and shows the current directory ("C:\Users\USER\Downloads\View folder (33)\Ilmagent").

In summary, the image depicts the process of building a Docker image for a Python application that likely involves machine learning or data science, given the packages used. The success of the build process is apparent.

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a JetBrains IDE (likely PyCharm or similar), displaying various windows and information related to a Python development task.

**Key Features:**

* **Explorer Window (left):** This shows a file directory structure, highlighting files like `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `Dockerfile`, `evaluate.py`, and others. The `llmagent` folder is expanded, suggesting this might be the project's main directory.  The `U` next to some files suggests they are open in the editor.

* **Editor Window (top-right):** An `env` file is shown, containing an environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN` with a long, seemingly encoded, value. This strongly suggests it's an API token used for authentication.

* **Terminal/Console Window (bottom-right):** This is the core of the information. It shows a command execution log detailing several steps:
    * **`uv run evaluate.py ...`:** This line is a command to execute a Python script called `evaluate.py`.  The command includes various arguments, such as an email address (`23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`), token counter, and port number.  The script's URL appears to be hosted on GitHub Gist. This strongly suggests an automated task or script running as part of some process.
    * **HTTP requests:**  The output shows HTTP POST and GET requests made to a localhost server (port 8000). The POST request fails with a `400 Bad Request` error, indicating a problem with the request's format or parameters. The error message points to a missing `HTTPException`. The GET request is successful.
    * **Task Results:** The output indicates the failure of a task (A2) due to a "system cannot find the file specified" error. This suggests a file path issue, potentially related to the `data/datefile.txt` mentioned in the next task.
    * **Final Task:** The last task describes counting Thursdays from a date file and writing the result to another file.

* **Problems, Output, Debug, Console Tabs:** These standard IDE tabs indicate where the output, debugging information, and any potential problems are displayed.

* **Bottom Status Bar:** The bottom status bar shows the currently opened file, further reinforcing that `app.py` and `llmagent` are central to the current task.


**In Summary:**

The image depicts the execution of a Python script (`evaluate.py`) likely involved in some kind of automated data processing pipeline. The script interacts with an external API (indicated by the token) and local files.  The script encountered a problem with the definition of an HTTPException and a file path error during task A2, but completed the final task successfully.  The overall context points towards a programming task involving date processing and API interaction, potentially as part of a larger project or experiment.

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a terminal window, likely from a development environment, displaying the results of a coding task.  Let's break down the key information:

**File Structure (Top Left):** A file explorer pane shows a directory named "NEW FOLDER (33)" containing several files, including `.env`, `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `Dockerfile`, `evaluate.py`, `LICENSE`, `readme.md`, `tasksA.py`, and `tasksB.py`.  The `.env` file shows a partially obscured API token.

**Terminal Output (Center):** The main part of the image displays the output from a program or script running in a terminal.  Here's a breakdown:

* **Task:** A task is described as determining if the statement "I hate you" has a positive or negative connotation. The program is expected to return "NEGATIVE" in uppercase and save it to `/data/c5.txt`.

* **HTTP Requests:** The output shows two HTTP requests.
    * A `POST` request to `http://localhost:8000/run` which appears to have failed (HTTP 400 Bad Request) due to a "No connection adapters were found" error.  This suggests a problem with the server configuration or connection.
    * A `GET` request to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/c5.txt` which successfully retrieves the file (HTTP 200 OK).

* **Results:**  The expected result is "NEGATIVE". The actual result, `[('NEGATIVE',)]`, suggests the program successfully processed and returned the expected output, despite the failed POST request earlier. This discrepancy highlights a potential issue where saving the file might not depend on the POST request's success.

* **C4 and C5:**  `C4 FAILED` indicates a failure in a specific test or step (likely related to the failed POST request). `C5 FAILED` appears unrelated to the main task and might be a separate test case failure.

* **Score:** A score of "6 / 25" suggests this is part of a larger test suite with multiple tasks.

* **Another HTTP Request:** An additional POST request is shown at the bottom, likely to a different endpoint (`https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`), which succeeded (HTTP 200 OK).

**Open Editors (Bottom Left):** The "Open Editors" section shows that `.env` and `app.py` are currently open in the IDE.

**Overall:** The image suggests a debugging session of a program designed to analyze sentiment. The program's core functionality works correctly (determining the sentiment), but a connection issue prevents the initial data saving step from completing successfully.  The discrepancy between the failed POST request and the successful retrieval of the correctly formatted data suggests an unexpected workflow in the application.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/8/e/8ef5cf5156fdaca65d927edf5d6c2463da4f7052.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a text output, likely from a log or report, detailing the submission of a software project to both GitHub and Docker repositories.

Here's a breakdown of the information:

* **Repository Submissions:**  The output first indicates the GitHub repository submitted (`https://github.com/23f2001390/lImagent`) and the corresponding Docker repository (`23f2001390/lImagent`).  Both use the same identifier.

* **Pre-requisites Check:** This section performs a series of checks to verify the project meets certain criteria.  Each check results in a 1 (pass) or 0 (fail).

* **Docker Repo Check:** Confirms the Docker repository exists and is publicly accessible, with a timestamp before February 18th.  The result is a pass (1).

* **GitHub Repo Checks:** Several checks are performed on the GitHub repository:
    * **Existence and Public Access:** Checks if the repository exists and is public, with a timestamp before February 18th. Result: Pass (1).
    * **License File:** Verifies the presence of a LICENSE or LICENSE.md file, specifically looking for an MIT License. Result: Pass (1).
    * **Dockerfile:** Checks for the existence of a Dockerfile within the repository.  Result: Pass (1).

In short, the image shows that all pre-requisites checks passed for the submission of the `lImagent` project to both GitHub and Docker, satisfying conditions including public accessibility and the inclusion of necessary files (LICENSE and Dockerfile).  The timestamp constraint suggests this is part of a submission process with a deadline.

Yes,the Same case happend to me also we have put lot of efforts in this project but after seeing that in mail you have no mit licence, I added that license but with name of mit license actually to just name that license file as MIT license but due to this all our hardwork is just an experience but actually we are not awarding any marks in project1 . I request the TDS team to consider this issue.

**Image Description:** The image contains a list of pre-requisites checks, each with a pass/fail indicator (1 for pass, 0 for fail).  The checks are related to the existence and state of Docker and Github repositories.  Specifically:

1. **Docker repo check:** Verifies that a Docker repository exists and is public, and that it has a timestamp before February 18th.  The result is 1 (pass).

2. **Github repo check (x2):**  This involves two checks:
    * Verifies that a Github repository exists and is public, with a timestamp before February 18th. The result is 1 (pass).
    * Checks for the existence of either a `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md` file (implying an MIT license).  The result is 1 (pass).
    * Checks for the existence of a `Dockerfile`. The result is 1 (pass).


The overall result suggests that all pre-requisites have been met successfully.  The use of "1" indicates successful completion of each test.  A "0" would indicate failure.

Respected Sir ,

@Jivraj

My roll number is 23f3001688

Pls check my repository properly because I have dockerfile in my repo but it is mentioned that it is not present.

Here is my repository link and screenshot for your reference sir and the dockerfile is present sir




github.com










GitHub - Sharmilecholan/tds_project1


Contribute to Sharmilecholan/tds_project1 development by creating an account on GitHub.














I think the mistake would have been because in my repo the file name is “dockerfile” and you have mentioned it as “Dockerfile” . So is it a mistake to put “D” in lowercase.

Kindly look into this sir because of this I got 0 in project 1 even though many of the tasks of my projects passed the evaluation test.

**Image Description:** This image is a screenshot of a GitHub repository page. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Repository Name:** The top line shows the repository's name: `Sharmiilecholan/tds_project1`. This indicates the owner's username ("Sharmiilecholan") and the project's name ("tds_project1").

* **GitHub Logo:** A stylized GitHub cat logo is visible in the bottom right corner, confirming the platform.

* **Repository Statistics:** Below the repository name, a set of statistics are displayed:
    * **Contributor:** Shows "1" indicating one contributor to the repository.
    * **Issues:** Shows "0", signifying no open issues.
    * **Stars:** Shows "0", meaning no stars (a metric of popularity).
    * **Forks:** Shows "0", implying that the repository hasn't been forked (copied and modified).

* **Project Icon:** A light grey square with a stylized, pixelated "H" in a purple/lavender color inside it is displayed near the right side. This could be a custom icon for the project or a placeholder.


In summary, the image shows a GitHub page for a new or inactive project with no issues, stars, or forks and one contributor.  The "H" icon suggests the project might relate to programming or technology, given GitHub's typical use.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/0/1/014b7a8714c79b6921eb8f8da545286cc6dbedc8_2_690x281.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a GitHub repository page.  The top left shows the repository name as belonging to user `Sharmilecholan` and the action taken was `Delete evaluate.py`.  The top right indicates that no description, website, or topics are provided for this repository.

The main body of the image is a list of files within the repository, each with the following information:

* **Filename:**  A list of files, including `.env`, `markdownlint.json`, `prettierrc.json`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, `tasksA.py`, and `tasks8.py`.  The file extensions suggest a Python project (`.py`), configuration files (`.json`, `.txt`), a Dockerfile, and a license file.

**Image Description:** This image shows a log of a seemingly automated process, likely a data processing pipeline or a test suite, which has encountered errors.  The log entries detail HTTP requests and responses, SQL queries, and file operations.

**Key Observations:**

* **Task Failure (B9):** The primary failure is labeled "B9 FAILED".  The task aimed to:
    1. Run a datasette instance (`uvx datasette /data/ticket-sales.db -port 8001`) in the background.
    2. Count Bronze tickets using a specific SQL query against `ticket-sales.csv`.
    3. Save the result to `/data/b10.csv`.
    4. Stop the datasette server.

    The HTTP POST request shows the task's attempt to execute this process, but it resulted in a `"HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error"` with a detail of `"filename"`. This suggests a file-related server-side problem.

* **Subsequent Failure (B10):**  A subsequent attempt to read the supposedly created `/data/b10.csv` file (`HTTP Request: GET`) failed with a "404 Not Found" error, indicated by "B10 FAILED: Cannot read /data/b10.csv". This reinforces that the file was not created successfully due to the earlier server error.

* **Successful Request:** At the end, a POST request to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings` is marked as successful ("HTTP/1.1 200 OK"), suggesting a separate, unrelated process completed successfully.  This might be the embedding of some text or data.

* **Score:** A score of "9/20" implies this is part of a graded test or a scoring system for this pipeline.

* **Top Information:**  `22f3000276@ds.s...` likely refers to a user ID or a session ID, possibly linked to the job or testing environment.

In summary, the image shows debugging information where a data processing task failed due to a server-side error (500) when attempting to create a CSV file.  A subsequent attempt to read the file then failed (404). A seemingly unrelated final request succeeded, suggesting a separate or later stage in the process.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/c/3/c342418d20b935d414f96817c92300bcec289598_2_225x500.jpeg)

**Image Description:** The image shows a screen capture of what appears to be a student's automated grading report for a coding assignment.  Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Top Section:**

* **Timestamp:** 15:37 indicates the time the report was generated.
* **Statement about outliers:**  "outliers do not influence the scores" suggests the grading system is robust to extreme values.
* **Final Score Calculation:** The final score is the minimum of 20 and the sum of the task score and bonus points.
* **Repository URLs:**  The report lists the submitted GitHub and Docker repositories, providing links to the code.  These are crucial for reviewing the student's work.
* **Pre-requisites Check:** This section shows a checklist of requirements, each with a pass (1) or fail (0) status.  The student passed all pre-requisites (Docker and GitHub repo existence, public accessibility, timestamp before Feb 18th, presence of LICENSE or LICENSE.md file, Dockerfile existence).

**Middle Section:**

* **Grid of Scores (A1-A10, B1-B10, C1-C5):**  This section shows a series of scores, all of which are 0.  These likely represent individual test cases or aspects of the assignment.  It is unclear what the A, B, and C categories represent.

**Bottom Section:**

* **Final Scores:** The student's task score is 0, the bonus score is 1, and the overall P1 score is 1.  This is calculated as MIN(20, 0 + 1) = 1.
* **Log Information:** The report explains that docker logs and evaluation logs are attached. The evaluation log is only provided if the API service started within 5 minutes.
* **Additional Files:**  The `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` files are provided for the student's learning and debugging purposes.  This indicates that the grading system itself is transparent and accessible.

**Overall:**

The image details a precise and automated grading process.  The student received a low task score (0) but got a bonus point (likely for a non-functional requirement), resulting in a final score of 1.  The provided logs and supplementary files assist the student in understanding the results and improving future submissions.

Sorry for late reply,These are 2 submissions that you made we are considering the latest one.

### Image Insight:

**Image Description:** The image shows a table of data, apparently a log or record of some kind.  The top shows a search bar with "22f2000559" entered. The table itself has four columns:

* **1:** A seemingly sequential row number (1, 499, 1060).
* **Timestamp:** Shows the date and time of an event.  Entries are "2/15/2025 23:56:09" and "2/16/2025 23:59:44".
* **Email Address:**  The same email address, partially redacted, appears in both rows: "22f2000559@ds.study.itm.ac.in".
* **Two data columns:**  These columns appear to record answers to questions. The questions are:
    * "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 1?"
    * "What is the name of the image published on DockerHub?"

The answers provided in the rows are:

* **Row 499:**
    * GitHub Link: `https://github.com/AnushkaAbhishekKumar/LLM-Project`
    * DockerHub Image Name: `coolsisters7/0c8a207a0c7c`
* **Row 1060:**
    * GitHub Link: `https://github.com/AnushkaAbhishekKumar/LLM-Project/tree/main` (Note the addition of `/tree/main` indicating a specific branch or directory within the repository)
    * DockerHub Image Name: `coolsisters7/4a79a3c81cd0`


In summary, the image documents two entries related to a user ("22f2000559@ds.study.itm.ac.in") providing a GitHub repository link and DockerHub image name at different timestamps. The difference in the GitHub links suggests that one points to the main project while the other points to a specific branch (`main`).

This is Senthur. I have reviewed the logs, and it indicates that the


/app/app/main.py
     file is missing. However, in my project directory, the


main.py
   file is located in the   
app/
   folder, and the   
run.py
   file is in the root folder of the project, which is   
LLM_Automation_Agent
  . This structure allows the 
run.py
 file to run the project without any issues by calling the appropriate functions from 
app/main.py
.


To run the project, the command I used is:


python run.py



Since 
run.py
 is placed in the root folder and not in any subfolder, it should properly execute the project without any errors, as it redirects the calls to 
app/main.py
.


I believe the evaluation may have been incorrect because the project was not executed in the way it was intended. I kindly request you to re-run the project using the 
run.py
 script located in the root folder (
llm-automation-agent
).


For your reference, I have attached screenshots from my local machine where the project was tested successfully, along with my GitHub screenshot.


Here is the GitHub link to my project:

**Image Description:** The image shows a GitHub repository page.  The main content is:

* **Repository Name:** `ksenthurkumaran1805200/llm-automation-agent`  This is likely the username and the name of the project.

* **QR-like Icon:** A stylized, teal colored, QR-code-like graphic is displayed to the right of the repository name.  It's not a functional QR code.

* **Repository Statistics:** Below the repository name and icon, the following metrics are shown:
    * **Contributor:** 1
    * **Issues:** 0
    * **Stars:** 0
    * **Forks:** 0

* **GitHub Icon:**  The GitHub logo is visible in the bottom right corner.


The overall appearance suggests a newly created or relatively inactive GitHub repository.  The numbers indicate it has one contributor but no reported issues, stars, or forks.

**Image Description:** The image shows a computer screen displaying two windows.

The top window is a code editor, predominantly dark-themed, showing lines of code.  The code appears to be JavaScript or a similar language, containing functions, variables, and possibly API calls. The code includes comments, which are explanatory text within the code itself. The file name visible at the top of this window seems to indicate it relates to a project called "fm-automation-agent". There is also some console output at the bottom of the window, showing logs/messages, some of which appear to be HTTP requests and responses (including IP addresses and timestamps).

The bottom window is a web browser displaying a dark-themed dashboard or control panel. The title bar shows a URL fragment, possibly from a service like GitHub or a similar repository hosting site, hinting that this interface is related to managing or monitoring a project. The content of this window shows a list, likely of files or resources, each with a description and some metadata (e.g., size, type, and last modified). The text "fm-automation-agent" is visible again at the bottom, further reinforcing the project name.

In short, the image displays what seems to be the development and management interface of a project called "fm-automation-agent," likely involving some type of automated process or task management based on the code snippets and the online dashboard's resource list.  The presence of HTTP requests in the code editor's console output suggests interaction with an external service or API.

Same here sir, i only changed LICENSE to MIT LICENSE due to the mail i received.

The LICENSE file was already present in the repo as i submitted my project. The change too was made on the 16th of Feb.

Sir, I would highly appreciate if you consider it as the rest of the pre-requisites are working well.Due to this, the project is also not being evaulated.

Thankyou

**Image Description:** The image shows a terminal window displaying a series of commands and their output.  The commands are all related to Docker and appear to be attempting to run a Python application.

Here's a breakdown of the key details:

* **Top Line:** The top line shows the terminal window's title bar, indicating the username (`root`), the hostname (`tds-course-temp-bq`), and the current directory (`/r`).

* **Docker Image Search:**  The first command searches for a Docker image using the `grep` command and a specific image ID: `22f3002902`.  The output shows this image exists, its tag is `latest`,  it has an ID of `c739ff8a3247`, is 1.13GB in size, and is 6 days old.

* **Docker Run Command:** The second command attempts to run the Docker image `c739ff8a3247`.  It uses environment variables (`-e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN`) and maps port 8000 (`-p 8000:8000`).

* **Error Message:** This command results in an error: `python: can't open file '/app/app/main.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory`. This indicates that the Python script `main.py`, located within the `/app/app` directory inside the Docker container, cannot be found. This is likely the main problem preventing the application from running.

In summary, the image depicts a troubleshooting scenario.  A user attempted to run a Dockerized Python application, but the application failed to start due to a missing `main.py` file within the container's file system.  The user needs to investigate why this file is missing and rectify the issue.

Oh I see what happened, the image names are different, I don’t know how, given I pushed the latest at 11:51pm and submitted the form at 11:59pm. Thank You 
@Jivraj
 for showing me.

Question: Now that I know. how can I test the container myself, if I want to do exactly what you guys are doing?

## Post #427 by 23F300327 (Post ID: 616718)
My code uses 
npx
 to format Markdown files using Prettier, specifically via 
subprocess.run(["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--write", ...])
, which assumes that 
npx
 is available in the environment. However, since the Docker container is based on Linux and I didn’t explicitly install Node.js or 
npx
, this results in an error during evaluation.


To test the functionality correctly, 
npx
 must be installed inside the running container. This can be fixed by entering the container and installing Node.js and npm using:


bash:
 apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm


Once installed, 
npx prettier@3.4.2
 should work as expected.


For reference, this approach worked perfectly when I tested the same task locally on my Windows 11 system, where 
npx
 is available by default.

Before the project evaluation, I ran the test script and successfully passed all Task A and Task B checks. I also built the Docker image as required.

But, when you gus evaluated , I get the following error:docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: exec: “uvicorn”: executable file not found in $PATH: unknown.

Could you please help me understand why this is happening even though the evaluation script ran fine?

**Image Description:** The image shows a screen capture of a GitHub repository's code editor. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Navigation Bar:**  A standard GitHub interface with tabs for "Code," "Issues," "Pull requests," "Actions," "Projects," "Security," and "Insights." A search bar is present in the top right corner.

* **File Explorer (Left Panel):** This panel lists the files within the repository. The highlighted file is `main`. Other files include `pycache_`, `data`, `.env`, `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`, and `tasksB.py`.  The presence of a `Dockerfile` suggests the project uses Docker for containerization.

* **Code Editor (Center Panel):** This is the main focus, showing a `Dockerfile`. The code is written in a dark theme, typical of code editors. The file contains commands for setting up a Python environment, installing dependencies using `apt-get` and `pip`, and running a FastAPI application. Key aspects of the code include:
    * **Base Image:** Uses a slim version of Python 3.12.
    * **Dependency Installation:** Installs system dependencies and Python packages, including libraries like SciPy, requests, and others.
    * **PATH Setting:** Sets the environment variable `PATH` to include the location of the installed application binaries.
    * **Application Directory:** Sets up the application directory.
    * **Copying Files:** Copies application files into the container.
    * **Port Exposure:** Exposes port 8000.
    * **Command to Run:** Specifies the command to start the FastAPI server.

* **Handwritten Note:** A handwritten note, likely made by the user, is visible near the top right; it seems to read "5 & 10 end". The arrow suggests that the user was drawing attention to a specific portion of the Dockerfile, possibly related to the note's meaning.

* **GitHub Copilot Suggestion:** A small banner suggests using GitHub Copilot for faster code writing.

In summary, the image displays a typical developer's workflow: working with a Python project utilizing Docker, potentially for deploying a FastAPI application.  The handwritten note suggests that the user might have made a note regarding the deployment process, perhaps related to the port number mentioned.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/3/0/300e62ae1bb91e990020843f9db4aab25bd9ac70_2_690x468.png)

The top shows the typical GitHub interface elements, including "Code," "Issues," "Pull requests," etc.  The left sidebar lists the files within the repository, including a `Dockerfile`, `README.md`, several Python files (`app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`), and other files.

The main part of the screenshot shows the content of the `Dockerfile`.  The code is written in Docker syntax and includes steps for:

1. **Setting a base image:**  Using a slim version of Python 3.12.
2. **Installing system dependencies:**  Using `apt-get` to install various libraries needed for SciPy and other libraries, also removing unnecessary files.
3. **Installing `uv`:**  Adding a `uv` installer script and then removing it.
4. **Installing Python packages:**  Using `pip` to install numerous Python packages such as `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `requests`, `scipy`, and others.
5. **Setting the PATH environment variable:**  Ensuring the installed binaries are accessible.
6. **Setting up the application directory:** Creating a directory `/app` and copying application files into it.
7. **Exposing port 8000:**  Making port 8000 available for external connections.
8. **Starting the FastAPI server:** Using `uvicorn` to run the application.


A handwritten note "mine" with an arrow pointing to the `Dockerfile` suggests the user considers this file their own work. The commit details (commit hash `2311000879` and the message "Added Dockerfile")  are visible at the top right of the `Dockerfile` section.  The line numbers are also visible, along with comments explaining each step.  The overall theme is dark, consistent with many code editors and GitHub interfaces.

Dear Sirs,


@Jivraj
 
@Saransh_Saini
 
@carlton


As per the Project 1 deliverables, I had submitted my Docker Hub repo, that hosted the Docker image. At the time of submission, the image was running smoothly, was fully accessible, and was successfully handling the API calls as intended.


Screenshot 2025-04-07 233513
805×197 9.52 KB


Github repo submitted:
 
GitHub - wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent


Docker repo submitted:
 wasimansariiitm/my-ai-agent


The previous evaluation was successfully conducted using my Docker image, which was responding as expected. However, during the subsequent evaluation, the image was rebuilt using my GitHub repo link, and unfortunately, the 
app.py
 file could not be found. As a result, my evaluation logs are missing from the evaluation logs bundle.


I would like to respectfully bring this to your kind attention that the 
app.py
 file does exist in the repository, but it is located inside a subfolder:


https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/app/app.py
.

But as per the submission instructions, I provided the GitHub repo link only: 
https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent
.


Humbly stating, I did not anticipate that the image will be rebuilt from the GitHub repo at a later stage due to some unforeseen circumstances. Had I known this, I would have made sure the project repo was structured appropriately to support that scenario. To be noted, that the earlier evaluation ran smoothly, and the app responded to all queries as expected.


I’m unsure what to expect now or request, but I just wanted to bring this issue to your notice. Even if I manage to get a single answer correct upon a successful evaluation, it would mean a lot to me and contribute meaningfully to my overall score. I would be extremely grateful if you could look into my case and extend your support in this matter.


Thank You and Regards,


24ds3000090

**Image Description:** The image contains a list of instructions, likely for a coding assignment or challenge.  The steps involve:

1. **Creating a Dockerfile:**  The first step requires creating a `Dockerfile` to build a specific application.

2. **Publishing to Docker Hub:** The built Docker image must then be published publicly to Docker Hub, a container registry.

3. **Running the image and verifying API access:** This step details how to run the Docker image using `podman run`.  Specific parameters are given, including environment variables (`AIPROXY_TOKEN`), port mappings (`-p 8000:8000`), and the image name (`$IMAGE_NAME`).  The successful execution should result in an API accessible via `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...` and `http://localhost:8000/read?path=...`  The ellipses (...) indicate further parameters are expected.

4. **Submitting to Google Form:** Finally, the user is instructed to submit the URLs of their GitHub repository (with placeholders for `user-name` and `repo-name`) and their Docker image name (also with placeholders) to a Google Form.


The most important details are the `podman` command, which is crucial for verifying the application's functionality, and the requirement to submit the GitHub and Docker image URLs to a Google Form, suggesting this is part of a larger submission process.  The use of placeholders (`$IMAGE_NAME`, `user-name`, `repo-name`, `AIPROXY_TOKEN`) indicates variables that need to be replaced with specific values during implementation.

Sir, in my docker logs, the datagen script encounters error during creating the credit card image for A8 during which it fails to find both the fonts used in the try and except blocks, resulting in the datagen script to stop abruptly without creating the files for A8 to A10.


image
1298×857 29.4 KB


I actually want to know if this could have been avoided by some changes in my code or is it an issue in the datagen.py script, because as the situation currently stands, my app wasn’t even tested properly for tasks A8 to A10 as the datagen.py script failed to create the required files because it could not find a font which as far as I knew was not specified that it must be included in my own code or image somehow.


Edit 1: I just realized that the datagen script looked for the fonts in python 3.13/site-packages/…

But my docker image is using the python:3.12-slim-bookworm. Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements.


Edit 2:

Even if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking.


image
1027×510 11 KB

Though an error occured in A8, A9 and A10 still could have worked if each of these function calls were enclosed in their own try-except blocks, ensuring independent checks for each task. But the current datagen.py script fails as error propagates to main, where it is not handled and causes abnormal termination without executing the functions for creating files for A9 and A10 as well.


Thank you.

Regards,

Shivaditya

**Image Description:** This image shows a Python traceback from a program called `datagen66arSL.py`.  The program is attempting to create an image with text using the Pillow (PIL) library.  The error messages indicate that the program failed to load two different TrueType font files:

1. **`arial.ttf`**: The first attempt tries to load `arial.ttf`.  The file path suggests it's looking for the font in the current working directory of the script.
2. **`/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf`**: The second attempt uses a system-wide font, DejaVu Sans.

Both attempts resulted in an `OSError: cannot open resource`. This means the program could not find or access either of the specified font files.  The traceback shows that the error occurs within the `ImageFont.truetype` function of the Pillow library, specifically at the point where the program tries to load the font.

The traceback details the call stack, showing the function calls that led to the error.  It includes file names, line numbers, and function names, allowing for debugging. The repeated error suggests a deeper issue – possibly font installation problems or permission issues preventing the script from accessing the font files. The virtual environment path `/root/.cache/uv/environments-v2/ffad51b5c0487eb6/lib/python3.13/site-packages/PIL/` is also visible, indicating the program is running within a virtual environment.

**Image Description:** The image contains a Python script.  The script uses the `argparse` module to parse command-line arguments. It takes an "email" argument and a "--root" argument (defaulting to "/data").  The script then creates a directory specified by the "root" argument using `os.makedirs` and makes sure that the directory exists before overwriting it.  It prints a disclaimer stating that the script is subject to change.

Finally, the script calls a series of functions, each seemingly processing or creating a different type of data (markdown formatting, dates, contacts, logs, documents, email data, credit card images, comments, and ticket sales).  The naming convention of the functions (e.g., `a2_format_markdown()`, `a3_dates()`) suggests an ordered processing of these data types. The script's main purpose appears to be to process and organize various kinds of data into a directory specified by the user.

Hi Haricharan


Your Dockerfile does not build the repo. Its misconfigured.

This is the error when building it:


=> ERROR [8/8] COPY .env /app/                                                                                                                         0.0s

This is because if you look at your Dockerfile .env does not exist in your repo.

Therefore it does not build.

Your docker is supposed to take the AIPROXY token from our environment not from yours.

This is passed dynamically at runtime of the Docker.


Since it fails to build, we cannot evaluate it.


Kind regards

**Image Description:** The image shows a snippet of a Dockerfile.  A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

The code sets up the application directory and copies application files.  Specifically:

* **`WORKDIR /app`**: This line sets the working directory inside the Docker image to `/app`.  All subsequent commands will be executed within this directory.

* **`COPY *.py /app/`**: This line copies all files ending in `.py` (presumably Python source code files) from the build context to the `/app` directory within the image.

* **`COPY .env /app/`**: This line copies a file named `.env` (likely containing environment variables) from the build context to the `/app` directory within the image.  This is highlighted by a red arrow in the image, possibly indicating its importance.

The lines starting with `#` are comments and serve to explain what the code does.  The image is primarily showing how to copy application files and the `.env` file into the application directory in a Docker build context.

Your container failed to run after building it.


docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: error during container init: exec: "uv": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown



Thats why we cannot evaluate it.

There is

some difference
 between both the applications. That is up to you to figure out. I can only tell whats wrong with yours. After building it and trying to run it this is the error we get. It fails to run as a result and we cannot evaluate it.

Hi,


Please let me know the reason on why I have not got any bonus marks.

1696×732 59.5 KB

### Image Insight:
![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/4/a4b4614f55f231153c89c3de51b0c0ae60d44633.png)

**Image Description:** This image shows a scoring rubric or grading sheet for a project.  Let's break down the sections:

**Top Section:**

* **Score Calculation:** The final score is determined by the minimum of 20 and the sum of the task score and bonus points.
* **Repository Submission:**  The Github and Docker repository submission URLs are provided. The Github repo is  `https://github.com/swati-iitm/project1_final`, and the Docker repo is `swatiiitm/project1_final`.

**Prerequisites Check:**

This section details the required conditions for the project, each with a pass/fail (1/0) indicator.  All prerequisites are marked as passed (1):

* Docker repository exists and is public before February 18th.
* Github repository exists and is public before February 18th.
* The Github repository contains a `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md` file (using the MIT license).
* The Github repository contains a `Dockerfile`.

**Grading Table:**

The main part of the image is a table with three rows (A, B, C) and ten columns (1-10), each cell containing a 0 or a 1 indicating whether that criterion was met.

* **Row A:** Shows a total of one '1' meaning only one criterion was met.
* **Row B:** Shows a total of one '1' meaning only one criterion was met.
* **Row C:**  Shows all '0's, indicating none of the criteria in this row were met.

**Final Scores:**

* **Task Score:** 3 points were earned on the main tasks.
* **Bonus:** No bonus points were awarded (0).
* **P1 Score:** The final score for the project (P1) is 4.

In summary, the image presents a detailed breakdown of a student's (or team's) project submission score, indicating successful prerequisite checks but a low score on the main project tasks and sub-tasks.  The low final score of 4 (out of a possible 20) suggests the project didn't meet many of the evaluation criteria.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/4/0/40c10210a7c33774133ec99e68ad77a840209387_2_690x297.png)

**Image Description:** This image shows a GitHub repository page for a project named "project1_final".  Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Repository Overview:**

* **Name:** `project1_final`
* **Status:** Public
* **Branches:** 2 (master is currently active)
* **Tags:** 0
* **Commits:** 9 commits, the current branch (`master`) is 8 commits ahead of the `main` branch.
* **Last Commit:** Made by `swati-iitm` a "last_minut" ago (indicating a recent update).
* **License:** MIT License

**File Structure (Partial):**

The left side shows a partial file structure of the repository.  Key files include:

* `_pycache_`:  A standard Python directory containing compiled bytecode.
* `data`: A directory likely containing data used by the project.
* `Dockerfile`: Suggests the project uses Docker for containerization.
* `LICENSE`: The MIT license file.
* `app.py`: Likely the main application file.
* `datagen.py`: Likely a file for generating data.
* `evaluate.py`:  Likely a file for evaluating results.
* `llm_code.py`:  Likely a file containing code related to large language models (LLMs).

**Activity:**

The right-hand side shows repository activity.  It indicates:

* **Stars:** 0
* **Watching:** 1 user is watching the repository.
* **Forks:** 0 forks.
* **Releases:** No releases have been published.  There's a button to create a new release.
* **Packages:** No packages have been published. There's a button to publish the first package.

**Overall:**

The repository appears to be a relatively new and small project that uses Python, potentially involving data generation, processing, and possibly using large language models.  The lack of description and absence of published releases and packages indicates it's likely a work in progress.

## Post #439 by carlton (Post ID: 616935)
We used some internal parameters with weights to auto calculate the bonus. Unless your submission met that threshold of 0.5 after scaling you would not get any bonus. Your score was normalised so instead of 3 you got 4 (3.75 got rounded up). But the metrics used to evaluate the quality of your submission only scored you at 0.007 which is far below the threshold required to get a bonus.

## Post #440 by Haricharan (Post ID: 617017)
Respected Sir,




Yes Sir, I said the same,  
.env
 was not able to be uploaded to repo as .env file was not allowed to be uploaded


when we download the repository it doesn’t have the 
.env
 file,


for docker image to build we need to add 
.env
 with 
AIPROXY_TOKEN


after that docker image will build, I had given about this in previous message


As you said Sir that you will use separate 
AIPROXY_TOKEN
…you can put that in 
.env
 file and build the docker image


after that Sir its optional to pass 
AIPROXY_TOKEN
 again while running the docker Image


just the 
.env
 file required, even without token in that it will work as project has support for both AIPROXY token in .env file and as environment variable




and when I uploaded to repository the .env file was not allowed to upload so had submitted that way, I actually forgot to add step for running the docker image in the previous message, the steps which I used:


git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/llmagent.git



adding 
.env
 with AIPROXY token and replacing 
evaluate.py
 and 
datagen.py
 with new ones according to test environment


docker build -t llm-agent .



docker run -p 8000:8000 llm-agent
or
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=token -p 8000:8000 llm-agent



and in another terminal


uv run evaluate.py --email=23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000



Thank you

Kind regards

Respected sir

I understand it’s my mistake sir and I apologize for that sir, but please consider this time sir since because of this my entire project score went from 9/20 to 0, which would make me difficult to pass this course and continue my diploma.

Please consider this request sir, sorry sir and this would never be repeated in future. My project evaluation was 9/20 initially sir, but later it came down to 0 because of this issue. Kindly consider sir please.

**Image Description:** The image shows a web interface, likely a control panel for a virtual machine or container, possibly within a platform like Play-with-Docker. 


Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Top Bar:** The URL `labs.play-with-docker.com/p/cvqlfo01209000cd7ic0#cvqlfo0l_cvqlfsol209000cd7icg` is prominently displayed.  This indicates a specific project or instance within the Play-with-Docker platform. The `#cvqlfo0l_cvqlfsol209000cd7icg` part is likely a unique identifier for the instance.

* **Top Right:** A browser's address bar is partially visible showing some search results or open tabs.

* **Top Left:** A digital clock shows the time `:44:22`.

* **Left Panel:** This section appears to be the session control area. It displays a "Close Session" button, wrench and gear icons (likely for settings and tools), and  the word "INSTANCE", suggesting this interface manages a running instance.

* **Central Panel:** This is the main area displaying information about the current instance.
    * **Instance ID:** `cvqlfo0l_cvqlfsol209000cd7icg` is repeated here, confirming its identifier.
    * **IP Address:** The IP address `192.168.0.13` is shown, indicating the instance's internal network address.
    * **"OPEN PORT" Button:** This suggests the ability to open specific ports on the instance for external access.
    * **Memory and CPU:**  Sections for memory and CPU usage are present, but the values are not visible.
    * **SSH Connection:** The line `ssh ip172-18-0-93-cvqlfo01209000cd7ic0@direct.labs.play-` provides an SSH connection string, showing the user can connect remotely via SSH.
    * **"DELETE" Button:** An option to delete the instance.
    * **"EDITOR" Button:** A button to access a code editor, likely for working with the instance's files.

* **Bottom Panel:** A terminal window is visible, running a docker command: `$ docker build -t tdsproject1:latest > tds-projlbuild.log`. This shows the user is building a docker image named `tdsproject1` and redirecting the build output to a log file.  The username seems to be `root`.

In summary, the image depicts a user interacting with a virtual machine or container through a web interface, performing tasks such as building a Docker image and managing the instance's network settings. The ID `cvqlfo0l_cvqlfsol209000cd7icg` is crucial for identifying this specific instance.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/b/8/b8f94b7678326660ebf7803d7c08ae0433b0dd59_2_690x54.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a commit message from a version control system, likely Git.  Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Line:** "Commits on Mar 30, 2025" indicates the date of the commit.

* **Main Commit Message:** "Update Dockerfile removed hard coded proxies" This is the primary description of the change made in this commit. It states that the Dockerfile (a file used to build Docker containers) has been updated to remove hard-coded proxy settings.

* **Author and Date:**  "rsjay1976 authored last week" identifies the author of the commit and indicates that it was made within the past week relative to the viewing time.

* **Verification Status:**  A green rectangular box labeled "Verified" suggests that the commit has undergone some form of testing and verification process, ensuring it meets quality standards.

* **Commit Hash:** "a71e3a8" is the unique identifier (SHA hash) for this specific commit in the version control history.  This is critical for referencing the change.

* **Other Icons (Right Side):** Three small icons are visible at the rightmost edge; their precise functionality depends on the platform but likely include options like viewing the commit details, accessing the file changes in this commit, or viewing different versions of the code.


In short, the image documents a software change that improves security and maintainability by removing hard-coded proxy settings from a Docker container configuration file.  The "Verified" status adds confidence in the correctness of the update.

No, we are not allowing any changes to repo after deadline, this is consistent rule for every student. We pulled your github repo latest commit before 18th feb, I am getting following error.

### Image Insight:
![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/b/d/bd6b7a633fa356674be001b8861629604fb08ea4_2_690x387.png)

**Image Description:** This image shows a terminal window displaying the output of a Docker build process.  The build is failing.  Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Command Execution:** The user is building a Docker image using the command `docker build -t 22f3002723:latest`.  The image is being built from a Dockerfile located within a specific directory structure.  The directory path is long and includes a timestamp (`22f3002723`) and a project name (`TDS-Project1-Jan25-...`).

**Build Stages:** The output shows the different stages of the Docker build: fetching Dockerfiles, downloading layers (from `docker.io/library/python:latest`), setting up the environment (using `apt-get`), and finally, attempting to check the version of the `uv` package (using `uv --version`).

**Error:** The build fails at the `RUN uv --version` stage. The error message is: `0.240/bin/sh: 1: uv: not found`. This indicates that the `uv` command or package is not found within the Docker container's environment after the previous steps have completed. The error's exit code is 127.

**Dockerfile:** A snippet of the Dockerfile is shown, revealing that the `RUN uv --version` command is intended to verify the `uv` package's installation (line 25). The comment on lines 23-27 confirms this purpose.


**Overall:** The image illustrates a common problem in Docker builds: a dependency (the `uv` package) is not properly installed or configured within the container's environment. The user needs to fix the Dockerfile to correctly install and configure `uv` before the build can succeed.

That destroys the purpose of containerization, your container should run anywhere anytime, all the dependencies must be preinstalled.

@Jivraj

As mentioned earlier, the pre Feb 18 dockerFile commited in GIT had  my office proxy url’s set as http_proxy and https_proxy.. It worked in my office envuironment and i tested everything in my office environment but based on the results which came on March last week realised that the proxies were preventing the uv to be installed in other environments.


Post that realised we have cloud based "docker playground’ utility where docker builds can be tested agonistic of any environment.. The good thing with playground is our instances last for only 3 hrs and next day we try we are kind of gauranteed of fresh environment without any caches,


Now after March 30th checkin validated the same in docker playground and ensured that the image got tagged and createdd successfully..


It would be great if the March 30th checkin could be considered, Again appreciate all your help so far.

**Image Description:** The image shows a GitHub repository page for a project titled "task_agent_api".  The page displays various aspects of the repository, including:

**Top Navigation Bar:**  A standard GitHub navigation bar is visible at the top, showing the repository's name and path (`23f1001822/task_agent_api`), and tabs for "Code," "Issues," "Pull requests," "Actions," "Projects," "Wiki," "Security," "Insights," and "Settings."

**Repository Information:**

* **Repository Name:** `task_agent_api` (marked as "Public").
* **Branch:**  Currently on the `main` branch.  Indicates 1 branch and 0 tags.
* **Commit History:** A list of commits is displayed, showing file changes and timestamps ("2 months ago" for all entries).  The most recent commit is by user `a09023e`.
* **File Structure:**  A file tree on the left shows the files within the repository.  Notable files include:
    * `myenv` (a directory, likely a virtual environment)
    * `__pycache__` (a directory containing compiled Python bytecode)
    * `env` (a file, possibly containing environment variables)
    * `LICENSE` (a license file)
    * `README.md` (a readme file)
    * `app.py` (likely the main application file)
    * `datagen.py` (possibly a data generation script)
    * `dockerfile` (a Dockerfile for building a Docker image)
    * `evaluate.py`
    * `requirements.txt` (listing project dependencies)
    * `task_api.py`

**Repository Metadata (Right-hand Panel):**

* **About:**  No description, website, or topics have been added to the repository.
* **Statistics:** Shows 0 stars, 1 watching, and 0 forks.
* **Releases:** No releases have been published yet.  A button to "Create a new release" is present.
* **Packages:** No packages have been published.  A button to "Publish your first package" is present.
* **Contributors:** Indicates 2 contributors.

**Overall:** The image depicts a relatively new GitHub repository, likely for a Python-based project (due to the presence of `.py` files and a `requirements.txt` file), which utilizes Docker for containerization. The absence of a description suggests the project is in its early stages of development.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/d/8/d83b83eaf69931596b2cddbbfea39884f17e047a_2_690x344.png)

**Image Description:** Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a GitHub repository page. 


Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Repository Identifier:** The top line displays `23f1001822/task_agent_api`. This is the unique identifier for the repository, indicating the owner (`23f1001822`) and the repository name (`task_agent_api`).

* **Repository Icon:** To the right, a simple graphic icon depicts a light grey square with a slightly darker purple rectangle on top, resembling a stylized representation of a software application or component.

* **Repository Statistics:** Below the main identifier, the image shows several statistics:
    * **Contributors:**  Displays "2" indicating the number of contributors to the repository.
    * **Issues:** Shows "0," meaning there are currently no open issues.
    * **Stars:** Displays "0," signifying no users have starred this repository.
    * **Forks:** Shows "0," indicating no forks have been created from this repository.

* **GitHub Logo:** In the bottom right corner, a small, muted version of the GitHub cat logo is visible.


In summary, the image provides a snapshot of a GitHub repository named `task_agent_api` that appears to be new or relatively inactive, with no open issues, stars, or forks.  The owner's ID is  `23f1001822` and it has two contributors.

I’ve got good news for you and 30 other students. Thanks to your diligent debugging effort that we were able to find this bug. For now the fix is that we will not evaluate you on a8 and catch the datagen exception so as to not cause cascading failures.


Thanks and kind regards.

We will let you know the outcome of the evaluations soon.

## Post #454 by carlton (Post ID: 617664)
Hi Hilal,


You have to recreate the test environment as shown in this post










Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies
 
Tools in Data Science





    To replicate the test environment: 
Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can  run this code using uv. 
# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   "requests",
# ]
# ///

import requests
import datetime as dt
import zoneinfo
import argparse
import os
import zipfile

parser = argparse.…
  




That way you will be able to identify why the error was occuring.


The specific error itself means:

Docker is trying to run the command uv inside your container, but it can’t find the uv executable — it’s not installed or not in the system PATH inside the container.


If you did not run evaluate.py as specified in our live sessions by recreating the test environment and then running evaluate.py then it would not have reflected how your dockerised application would work.


Kind regards

Hi

Following was your submission, which is not a valid dockerrepo.

**Image Description:** The image shows a code-review interface, possibly from a platform like GitHub or GitLab.  The top section displays options for "Preview," "Code," and "Blame," indicating code-related actions. It also provides file statistics: 1069 lines, 1069 lines of code, and a file size of 127 KB. A search bar displays the query "22f3003083/v1."

Below the header, a table is shown.  The table has columns labeled "Timestamp," "Email Address," and two questions:

1. **"What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 1?"** The answer provided in the row is: `https://github.com/223003083/TDS_Project_1`

2. **"What is the name of the image published on DockerHub?"** The answer provided in the row is: `22f3003083/v1`

The row also shows a timestamp (`2/16/2025 23:20:17`) and an email address (`22f3003083@ds.study.itm.ac.in`). The overall context suggests a review of code for a project ("Project 1") hosted on GitHub and Docker Hub.  The ID "22f3003083/v1" appears to be central to identifying the project across both platforms.

Hi Jayaram,


Unfortunately, we are not able to relax restrictions on changes to your repo, regardless of the reason. We have kept this rule uniform for everyone. If we allow this change, then everyone has a legitimate reason to request changes and would make the rule meaningless because then everyone will be able to make corrections to their submission. We do not even allow spelling changes.


Kind regards

@carlton
 ..  just a small suggestion, to avoid scenarios like what i faced and also with softwares like docker/podman not being too windows friendly, i think students can find it easier if a dev/mock  linux env is provided for course term duration, instead of   everyone having to figuring out with AWS/Azure and all providers.. Anyway thanks and appreciate all the help

**Image Description:** The image shows a table with data related to timestamps, email addresses, GitHub repository links, and DockerHub image names.  The table appears to be a log or record of some activity.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant features:

* **Search Query:** At the top, a search query "23f1001236" is visible. This likely relates to the email addresses in the table.

* **Columns:** The table has four columns:
    * **1 (Index):** A numerical index, presumably for each row/entry.
    * **Timestamp:**  Shows the date and time of each entry.  The dates are in February 2025.
    * **Email Address:**  All entries share the same email address, `23f1001236@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.
    * **GitHub Link & DockerHub Image Name:**  This column is split into two sections.  The first shows the links to GitHub repositories, all belonging to the user "MaheshSingh01". The second shows the names of the corresponding images published on DockerHub.

* **Data Entries:** There are three data entries, each with the same email address, but different timestamps, GitHub repository links (two point to `tdsrepos.git` and one to `tds_proj.git`), and DockerHub image names (two are `maheshsingh01/tdsrepos` and one is `maheshsingh01/tds-proj`).

In short, the image shows a log seemingly tracking the activities of an individual (with the email address `23f1001236@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`) related to a project ("Project 1") hosted on GitHub and DockerHub under the username "MaheshSingh01."  The differences in the GitHub links and DockerHub image names suggest different versions or aspects of the project.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/1/7/174c8e4e8ad4c6e537203447df3d370b0efa8782_2_690x350.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a Docker Hub webpage displaying a "404 Not Found" error. 


Here's a breakdown of the relevant features:

* **URL:** The address bar shows the URL: `https://hub.docker.com/r/maheshsingh01/tdsrepos/tags`. This indicates the user was attempting to access tags within a specific Docker repository (`tdsrepos`) belonging to a user named `maheshsingh01`.

* **Error Message:** The main content of the page is a large, circular, blue element containing the text "404," "Oops!", and the message "The page you have requested was not found." This is a standard 404 error, indicating that the requested resource is not available on the server.

* **Docker Hub Branding:** The top of the page shows the Docker Hub logo and branding, confirming the error occurred within the Docker Hub platform.

* **Navigation:**  The top bar includes a search bar, login/signup options, and a typical browser navigation bar.

* **Navigation Breadcrumbs:** Below the header, there are breadcrumbs showing the navigation path: `Explore / maheshsingh01 / tdsrepos`.

In summary, the image displays a standard 404 error on the Docker Hub website while accessing the tags associated with the repository `tdsrepos` owned by the user `maheshsingh01`.  The error suggests that the specific page or resource requested does not exist on the Docker Hub server.

**Image Description:** This image shows a list of files and their actions within a version control system, likely Git.  The main section displays a table with two columns.

**Column 1:** Lists the filenames. These appear to be related to a Python project:

* `.dockerignore`
* `.gitattributes`
* `.gitignore`
* `LICENSE`
* `README.md`
* `app.py`
* `datagen.py`
* `Dockerfile`
* `evaluate.py`
* `requirements.txt`
* `tasksA.py`
* `tasksB.py`


**Column 2:**  Indicates the action performed on each file, which is consistently "added" for all files. The "Initial commit" entry next to `.gitattributes` suggests this is the initial creation of the project's repository.


**Other Relevant Information:**

* **Top Row:** Shows the username "wag28" as having performed the action "added".  Next to it, "eff178a" appears to be a commit ID or similar identifier and the timestamp "2 months ago" indicates when the action occurred.

* **Right Side Column:** Contains icons and labels that seem to be part of a graphical interface for the version control system, likely showing options or further details associated with the displayed entries.  These seem to be related to project management features such as reporting or access controls but are not fully legible within the image.  Words partially visible here include "No", "Rep" (possibly representing "Report"), "Pac" (possibly part of a longer word, perhaps "Package"), "Lan" (possibly part of a longer word, or a label indicating language), and several icons suggesting common Git actions like reading documentation and managing issues.


In summary, the image depicts a recent commit (or a series of commits bundled) to a Git repository, showing the addition of various files in a Python project.  The right-hand column suggests a richer interface providing additional context or options within the system.

The docker image which I share is working at my end.  The size of the image is 6 GB which may take more than 5 minutes to load as I wasn’t aware of the infra level restrictions.

**Image Description:** This is an email from Carlton D'Silva sent on April 9th.  The email is addressed to a "Dear Learner," and concerns the grading of a project (P1).

The main point is that the learner's P1 submission failed a prerequisite because the `Dockerfile` wasn't in the root directory of their GitHub repo.  This requirement is now relaxed.  However:

* **Submissions will be reviewed only *after* the end of term.**  A script will search the entire GitHub repo for the `Dockerfile`.
* **No changes to the GitHub repo after February 18th will be considered.**
* **No spelling errors in the required files will be accepted.**
* **All other prerequisites must still be met.**
* **The Docker image must build without errors and the container must be operational within 5 minutes of starting.**
* **Evaluation will be done according to the specified test environment.**

The email includes a profile picture of the sender and email interface elements like reply, forward, and notification counters (99+ unread emails, 4 unread messages).

@Jivraj

Respected Sir,


I hope you are doing well.

This is with reference to your confirmation mail that my project 1 will be re-evaluated after end term

I would like to sincerely apologize for the oversight in my Project 1 submission. Upon reviewing my GitHub repository, I realized that the file was named 
dockerfile
 (with a lowercase ‘d’) in the Github root repo instead of the required 
Dockerfile
 (with an uppercase ‘D’).


While the contents of the file were correct and my project passed several evaluation tests, I understand that the evaluation script could not detect the Dockerfile due to this naming issue. I genuinely did not intend to deviate from the standard, and I now fully understand the importance of following naming conventions precisely.


I humbly request you to kindly consider this as an honest mistake and allow a one-time exception, Please sir. This issue has unfortunately resulted in my project score being reduced to 0, which puts my overall course performance at risk. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and such an error will not occur again in the future.

So, I hope you will look at this and re-evaluate my project as I put lots of efforts to complete it.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.


Warm regards,

S. Sharmile
