**Image Description:** The image shows a dark-themed webpage, likely a course website or learning management system. 


The left side displays a navigation menu with the heading "Tools in Data Science".  Below this, a searchable list of topics is visible, including:

* Tools in Data Science
* Development Tools
* Deployment Tools
* Large Language Models
* Data Sourcing
* Data Preparation
* Data Analysis
* Data Visualization


The right side features information about the course, including:

* **Teaching Assistants:**  Contact information for two teaching assistants, including an email address and a Twitter handle (@Jivraj).  One is named Jivraj Singh and the other is a virtual TA using GPT.


* **Course Links:**  This section provides links to relevant course resources, such as a discussion forum ("TDS Discourse"), a student handbook for the IITM BS Degree Programme, and the main course page.

* **Jan 2025 Links:** This section lists links specifically for January 2025, including:
    * Grading Document
    * Course page
    * Course calendar
    * Announcement group
    * Course material (Jupyter notebooks, datasets)
    * TA sessions (YouTube playlist)


The overall appearance suggests a well-organized and structured online learning environment.  The presence of specific dates ("Jan 2025") indicates that the material is time-sensitive. The repeated abbreviation "TDS" likely refers to "Tools in Data Science".
