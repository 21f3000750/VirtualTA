Chat GPT has stepped up the game and I am excited 


Now I can not only generate the code, but can run it and ask it to fix the error with a single click. This changes software development and I guess we are moving in the direction we all know. It also makes this course a lot more important -  the number of new things that I have learnt from this course which I am able to directly apply to my day to day work is immense. Thanks to 
@s.anand
 and the entire course team who designed this amazing course


I hope ChatGPT solves deployment next

### Image Insight:

**Image Description:** The image shows a split screen.  The left side displays a ChatGPT conversation, while the right shows a code editor with Python code and a console output.

**Left Side (ChatGPT):**

This section shows a conversation between the user and ChatGPT.  The user has a problem related to SSL configuration in their Python code.  ChatGPT provides a solution: updating the code to handle environments without SSL using the `certifi` library and checking the `PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY` environment variable.  The error message "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ssl'" is explicitly mentioned, indicating the issue ChatGPT solved.

**Right Side (Code Editor & Console):**

The main part of this section contains Python code which appears to be fetching data from a Wikipedia page using the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries.  The code is designed to take a country name as input, format a Wikipedia URL, fetch the page, parse the HTML, and extract headings (H1 to H6).

* **Code Comments:**  The code is well-commented, explaining each section's purpose: formatting the URL, fetching the page, parsing the HTML, and extracting headings.

* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block handles potential errors during the Wikipedia page fetch, returning a JSON response with an error message if the status code is not 200 (OK).

* **Console Output:** At the bottom, the console displays "Run successfully". This indicates the code executed without any runtime errors, after the changes suggested by ChatGPT.

* **Import Errors (Below Console):** Below the "Run successfully" message, a stack trace is shown.  This is a *trace-back* from when the application first started.  This trace-back shows errors related to importing modules, such as `starlette` and `anyio`. These errors were resolved by the changes made to handle the lack of SSL, as the  'ssl' module is clearly shown as imported successfully at the very end of the trace-back.  The trace-back confirms the issue was resolved successfully.


In summary, the image depicts a successful troubleshooting session.  The user encountered an SSL-related error in their Python code. ChatGPT provided a solution, which was implemented and successfully ran, solving the original `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ssl'` error.  The stack trace shows import errors that are now resolved.
