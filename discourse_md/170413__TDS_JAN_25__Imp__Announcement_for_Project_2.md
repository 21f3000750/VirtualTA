Hi 
@carlton
 ,


Will this session be recorded and shared later?

It conflicts with live session of BA and that session is specially told that It will not be recorded.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot or video feed of a video call, likely conducted through Google Meet.

**Central Figure:**
*   The primary subject is a man with graying hair and a somewhat serious expression.
*   He is wearing a light-colored shirt.
*   He appears to have a microphone or headset on, as there are wires near his face and in his ears.

**Environment:**
*   The background appears to be a plain white wall.
*   To the left of the man is an electrical outlet with a plug inserted.

**Interface Elements/Text:**
*   In the upper right corner, there's a "Google Meet" logo, indicating the platform being used for the video call.
*   In the bottom left corner, it displays "Anand S", indicating the person's name or nickname in the video call.

**Possible Inferences:**
*   The image appears to be a screen recording, potentially taken during a meeting or a personal video call.
*   The setting is a basic room, with a simple background.
*   The person in the picture seems to be engaged in the video call.
