Hi 
@carlton
,

I was working on GA7 as part of Task 4 in 7.1. In task 4.Sheet1, the columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. While I could extract Series ID and Item, I couldn’t locate Year, Month, or Value in the dataset. Could someone please assist me with this?

**Image Description:** The image is a screenshot of a Google Sheets document, likely presenting data related to the pharmaceutical industry. Here's a breakdown:

**Structure:**

*   The document is organized in a spreadsheet format, with rows and columns.
*   Column A seems to contain a "key" title for the information in each row.
*   Column B contains corresponding details, descriptions, or data entries.
*   The data is presented in two distinct sections.

**Content:**

1.  **Section 1: Pharmaceutical Data - Anticoagulants, Hemostatics, and Digitalis Preparations**
    *   **Series Title:** PPI industry data for Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing-Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations, not seasonally adjusted
    *   **Series ID:** PCU3254123254127111
    *   **Seasonality:** Not Seasonally Adjusted
    *   **Survey Name:** PPI Industry Data
    *   **Measure Data:** Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations
    *   **Industry:** Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing
    *   **Item:** Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations

2.  **Section 2: Pharmaceutical Data - Calcium Channel Blockers**
    *   **Series Title:** PPI industry data for Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing-Calcium channel blockers, not seasonally adjusted
    *   **Series ID:** PCU3254123254127114
    *   **Seasonality:** Not Seasonally Adjusted
    *   **Survey Name:** PPI Industry Data
    *   **Measure Data:** Calcium channel blockers
    *   **Industry:** Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing
    *   **Item:** Calcium channel blockers

**Key Observations:**

*   The data is related to the Producer Price Index (PPI) in the pharmaceutical industry.
*   The spreadsheet compares and contrasts different pharmaceutical products with different series identifiers.
*   Both data entries are marked as "Not Seasonally Adjusted".
*   The "Industry" and "Item" entries provide details about the specific pharmaceutical products.
*   The two sections provide comparison of specific product categories for the pharmaceutical industry.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a question presented in a form, likely for a data analysis assignment or a similar task. The question is related to analyzing the impact of pharmaceutical exports from India to the US.

**Key elements and their details:**

*   **Question Number:** "Question 7.1" is displayed, indicating it's part of a larger set of questions.
*   **Scenario Description:**
    *   A new political party, the Buddhi Daya Nyaay (BDN), is interested in analyzing the effect of India's pharmaceutical exports to the US on its economy.
    *   The export value for FY 2024 is given as ₹2,42,888 Crores.
    *   The task is to conduct an insightful analysis using provided CSV files.
*   **Provided Files:**
    *   "Industry Product Segment Information"
    *   "Monthly Price Indices for Segments (Two-year data)" - this suggests the availability of data related to different industry segments and price indices over two years.
*   **Tasks (Instructions):**
    *   **Google Sheet Workbook:** Create a new blank Google Sheet workbook and name it "ga.7.1.rollno," replacing "rollno" with the user's IITM roll number (excluding the domain).
    *   **Sharing:** Share the Google Sheet with editing rights to the email address se2002@study.iitm.ac.in. Failing to do this first on a blank workbook means the submission won't be considered.
    *   **Sheet Names:** Make sure the sheet names are as given below.
    *   **Sheet1 (Data Structure):** Include columns: Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value.
    *   **Sheet2 (Pivot Table):** Create a pivot table with Item as rows, Year and Month as columns in hierarchical order, and Value as the values.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The form is likely recording the email address of the person filling it out.
*   The instructions provide clear guidance on creating a Google Sheet, setting up a data structure, and generating a pivot table.
*   The task involves data analysis to extract insights from the given data.

In the GA 7.1 part it is said that we need data of which columns are




but the dataset provided has no column named “Item”

### Image Insight:
![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/6/a6fdec02b5239ef02c5198e250c8a2d6eb007b82.png)

**Image Description:** The image contains text describing the columns in a spreadsheet named "Sheet1". The text states "4. Sheet1: Columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value." This suggests a dataset or table where each row represents a data point and includes the following attributes: Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. The number "4." likely indicates this is the fourth point or item on a list.

**Image Description:** The image shows a table with data related to a series of some kind. The table has five columns: "Series ID", "Year", "Period", "Label", and "Value". The table has two rows of data. The first data row has: "Series ID" of "PCU3254-3254-", a "Year" of "2023", a "Period" of "M01", a "Label" of "2023 Jan", and a "Value" of "562.445". The second data row appears to have "2023" for year, "M02" for period, "2023 Feb" for label, and "565.040" for value.

Below items don’t have prices.










PCU3254123254127111


Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations










PCU3254123254127114


Calcium channel blockers






PCU325412325412MM


Miscellaneous receipts






PCU325412325412D112OC


Other digestive or genito-urinary preparations, over-the-counter






PCU325412325412D113


Antacids






PCU325412325412SS


Secondary products






PCU3254123254127112


ACE inhibitors








Some items don’t have prices for all 24 months.

Although the assignment says 24 months (I assumed 2023 January to 2024 December) data, many items have prices for 2025 Jan as well.




Monthly Price Indices for Segments (Two-year data)




Shall I delete the records for which price is not available?

**Image Description:** The image displays a spreadsheet, likely from Google Sheets or a similar program. The spreadsheet appears to be summarizing sales data for various pharmaceutical products. 

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Header Row (Row 1-3):** The top row shows "SUM of Value" at the top, followed by "Item" in column A. Column B is "Year" and column C "Month" and then a set of columns are labeled with the month of the year in 2023.
*   **Column A: Item:** This column lists different categories of pharmaceutical products, such as "ACE inhibitors", "Analgesics", "Antacids", "Anticonvulsants", etc.
*   **Column B: Year and Total:** In B, it displays the "Total" value per item
*   **Columns D-H : Data for 2023:** Columns D through H seem to contain monthly data for the year 2023 (M01, M02, M03, M04, M05).

*   **Highlighted Rows (ACE Inhibitors and Antacids):** There are two rows with the beginning value being 0.

The spreadsheet presents a clear structure for analyzing sales performance across different pharmaceutical categories and over time. The data is organized, making it easy to compare sales figures and identify trends.

Hi Tanya,


Both you responses have been recorded. So it has not been deleted. Its just the way google forms works, it does not reload your previous responses.


Kind regards

---

## Post #25 by carlton (Post ID: 611762)
The question asked for top 5 countries. So that would be the approach for this question, not aggregated economic groups.

Hi 
@carlton
 sir,

I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email.


Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded?

Hi Shambhavi, Thanks for the update. We will look into it.


Thanks once again

---

## Post #28 by 24f2003130 (Post ID: 617714)
Sir,

In case we are not provided access to view their respective sheets, we would have no option but to either leave the column blank or mark it as 0. However, if others have marked it differently based on their available information, there is a possibility that our responses may vary — potentially exceeding the permissible variance limit of ±33%.


In such a scenario, would this mean we would not be eligible for the bonus?


Additionally, it would be really helpful if a uniform approach or standard marking could be communicated for such cases where access is not granted. This would ensure consistency across all submissions and avoid discrepancies arising from random or subjective entries, which seems to be happening currently.

If you are not provided access, contact the peer. Their email is there in the html file. It’s in the peers interest 
and
 yours. That’s an important aspect of GA7, it’s to get people to work together and collaborate.

Peer reviews like the real world is going to be messy. The way to reduce the messiness is to communicate with one another.

@carlton

sir can you please clarify what do we have to write in google form if there is no submission?

---

## Post #31 by carlton (Post ID: 618110)
You have two options. Get in touch with the peer (you have their email address), this is the recommended approach. Or you could give them zero because you were not able to evaluate their submission.
