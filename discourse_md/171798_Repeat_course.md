Even if I pass in end term TDS, Can I repeat the course in next term because I missed project1 and my CGPA will go down because of it?


This is my last term of diploma. So, can I take 1 diploma course and rest degree courses in next term?

Yes, you can.

More details given in student handbook. Search for repeat courses.

### Image Insight:

**Image Description:** This image contains text outlining a policy or procedure for repeating courses to improve grades.  The key details are:

* **Title:** "12.5.3 Repeating a Course for Improvement" indicates this section is about retaking courses.

* **Eligibility:** Applicable to courses with grades A, B, C, D, or E.

* **Process:** Students can retake courses to improve their grade; the highest grade achieved will be recorded.  The total number of courses taken must remain within the "CCC limit" (the meaning of CCC is not defined in the image).

* **Cost:** Retaking a course for improvement will double the normal course fee.

* **Registration:** Improvement courses can be registered at any level (example given: a foundation course can be taken at the diploma level).

* **Recommendation:** The text strongly suggests students try new courses rather than repeating, unless absolutely necessary for improvement.  All course materials from completed courses remain accessible.


The image primarily communicates rules and advice about grade improvement via course repetition within an educational institution.  The "CCC limit" is the only undefined term which would need further clarification.

TDS is the worst subject to repeat in order to improve CGPA.


Its better to take a high credit, easy course to improve CGPA. 
We never recommend taking TDS for grade improvement.
 If you have passed it, its better to move on.

Just as matter of interest, even on campus IITM MTech students take foundation Python course from BS Program to artificially improve their on campus CGPA (they take it as an elective).


So if the CGPA is that big a deal, do an easy 4 credit course and get an S. Dont repeat hard subjects, thats just a waste of time.

This is not up to us. We make adjustments within assignments and projects and we have done that already. For course level bonuses, that is the discretion of operations.
