Sir I thought that the ‘LICENSE’ file had to be renamed to ‘MIT LICENSE’.

Can you please look into it. Thankyou!

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Context:**

The image appears to be a webpage or a section of a webpage, likely the interface of a code repository platform like GitHub or GitLab. It displays the contents of a project named "tds_project-1."

**Key Elements and Their Details:**

*   **Project Name and Status:**
    *   "tds\_project-1" is the name of the project.
    *   "(Public)" indicates the project's visibility.

*   **Navigation/Branching Information:**
    *   The active branch is "main".
    *   There is "1 Branch".
    *   There are "0 Tags".

*   **Commit Information:**
    *   "22f3000585 Create LICENSE" is a commit message.
    *   "c61a6ef - now" indicates a commit.
    *   "6 Commits"

*   **File/Directory Structure:**
    *   The image shows a listing of files and directories within the project. They include:
        *   `_pycache_` (likely a directory related to Python caching)
        *   `venv` (likely a virtual environment directory for Python)
        *   `Dockerfile` (suggests a Docker container setup)
        *   `LICENSE` (indicates a license file, and now appears to have been created 'now')
        *   `MIT LICENSE` (A renamed license file, probably from the original "LICENSE")
        *   `app.py` (a Python source file likely containing the main application logic)
        *   `requirements.txt` (a file listing dependencies, typically for Python projects)
        *   `test.txt` (a text file likely for testing purposes)

*   **File Metadata (Timing):**
    *   Each entry shows the timestamp, e.g., "2 months ago".

*   **Actions and Controls:**
    *   "Go to file" (a search box)
    *   "Add file" (a button to add new files)
    *   "< > Code" (a button potentially providing access to code related functionalities)
    *   "Pin"
    *   "Unwatch"

**In essence, the image presents a snapshot of a coding project, revealing its structure, some recent changes (indicated by commit messages), and basic version control information.**

**Image Description:** The image is a text-based document evaluating a student's Project 1 prerequisites. 

**Key components:**

*   **Heading:** States the consequence of not meeting the minimum requirement: the submission will not be evaluated.
*   **Evaluation list:** A list of specific prerequisite checks and their results.

    *   "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS"
    *   "Is Github repo present AND public: PASS"
    *   "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: PASS"
    *   "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL"
*   **Overall Results:** Shows that the prerequisites have "FAIL" and the "Project 1 Score" is 0.

**Overall Impression:**
The student failed to meet the requirements for Project 1 as a result of failing to present the MIT license, resulting in a zero score.

Hi 
@22f3000585


Standard MIT License naming criteria is to be named as LICENSE or LICENSE.md(all caps).


Adding a license to a repository - GitHub Docs


Kind regards

Sir, this is why i renamed it to ‘MIT LICENSE’.

Sir can you please consider it. Thank you!

**Image Description:** The image shows a message indicating that a submission has failed. Here's a breakdown:

**Text Content:**

*   **Overall Message:** "We see that your submission [URL] has a result of FAIL due to the below reasons:"
*   **Submission URL:** The URL provided is: https://github.com/22f3000585/tds\_project-1.git
*   **Reasons for Failure:** The image lists three reasons why the submission failed, highlighted with yellow background:
    *   "No such repo"
    *   "No "MIT" in LICENSE"
    *   "No Dockerfile"

**Visual Features:**

*   The text is displayed in a clean, sans-serif font.
*   The URL is a blue hyperlink, presumably to the submission's repository on GitHub.
*   The reasons for failure are highlighted in a yellow color.
*   The text is simple and easy to read.

**Overall Interpretation:**

The image shows a report on a code submission. The submission, which appears to be a project hosted on GitHub, failed due to the listed issues. The problems involve missing elements: the repository does not exist, the project lacks a MIT license, and does not have a Dockerfile.

Same here. I also added and saved the file as MIT license because of the following message. I request you to please consider evaluating the project.

**Image Description:** The image is a white background with black text. The text contains instructions or information related to a submission process. Here is a breakdown:

*   **Top Line:** "No "MIT" in LICENSE;No Dockerfile". This appears to be a checklist item or requirement for a submission, indicating that the presence of "MIT" in a LICENSE file and a Dockerfile are not allowed.
*   **Second Line:** "Please ensure that your submission passes the above checklist for it to be even considered for scoring." This is a directive, emphasizing that the checklist must be followed for the submission to be evaluated.
*   **Third Line (Note):** "Note: We've only considered your **latest** submissions, as we permitted students to submit more than once." This clarifies that only the most recent submission will be graded and offers context, indicating that multiple submissions were allowed. The word "latest" is bolded and underlined to emphasize its importance.

Overall, the image presents clear instructions or feedback related to a process, probably for an assignment or a competition where there are specific requirements and multiple submission attempts are allowed.

I completely appreciate that you feel these are minor issues.


But the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.


Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.

Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible.


These things do matter when done at scale.  Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter.


Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.


We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.


I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.


Kindest regards

Sir,

Thankyou for your prompt reply to my query.

I wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’ on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the 16th of Feb itself).

I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th.

I completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it.

Thankyou!

One thing we are doing is looking at the latest commit before the 18th of Feb. So if it was correct before the 18th of Feb then we will consider it and evaluate it, but it has to be precisely what is expected. If so, then your submission will be evaluated by building the image from the docker manifest in the github present at the version before the 18th.

**Image Description:** Here is a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Structure:**
The image presents a list of pre-requisite checks, likely related to a software project or code repository. Each check has a descriptive title followed by a numeric result (either 1 for pass or 0 for fail).

**Textual Content:**

*   **Title:** "Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)". This indicates that each check is evaluated as either passing (1) or failing (0).

*   **Check 1:** "Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1". This check confirms the existence of a public Docker repository and the fact that it meets a timestamp requirement (presumably related to its creation or last modification). The result "1" signifies that this check passed.

*   **Check 2:** "Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1". Similar to the first check, this one confirms the existence of a public GitHub repository and its compliance with a date-related requirement. The result "1" indicates a pass.

*   **Check 3:** "Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 0". This check searches for a license file (LICENSE or LICENSE.md) within the GitHub repository. The presence of the MIT license is explicitly mentioned. The result "0" indicates this check failed; no license file was found.

*   **Check 4:** "Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists: 1". This checks for the existence of a Dockerfile in the GitHub repository. The result "1" indicates that the Dockerfile exists and the check passed.

**Key Features and Objects:**

*   **Check categories:** The text is neatly organized into a numbered list, each line representing a specific pre-requisite check.

*   **Status indicators:** The checks' success or failure is clearly indicated by the numeric results (1 or 0).

*   **File names and extensions:** Mention of "LICENSE", "LICENSE.md", and "Dockerfile".

*   **License type:** "MIT License" specified.

*   **Timestamp/Date:** Implies some aspect of the repository that has to do with time "timestamp before 18th of Feb".

**Overall Interpretation:**

The image is a report showing the pre-requisites that are met or not for a software project. The Docker and Github repository requirements are met, while the MIT license file is not present, and Dockerfile is present. The purpose of this check appears to be to verify that project components are set up correctly before another operation takes place, possibly a build or deployment.

**Image Description:** The image is a text-based message indicating the result of a submission. The text states that the submission, identified by a GitHub URL, resulted in a "FAIL". The reasons for the failure are then listed: "No such repo", "No "MIT" in LICENSE", and "No Dockerfile". This suggests that the submission was related to a software project that was being evaluated, likely a project submitted for code review or testing, and it failed due to issues with the repository and licensing, including the missing Dockerfile.

**Image Description:** The image is a file browser interface, likely from a version control system like Git, displaying the contents of a repository branch. The title of the branch is "22f3000585 Create LICENSE". There's a green icon in the top left corner followed by "Create LICENSE".

Key details include:

*   **Branch Name and Activity:** The branch name/commit ID is "22f3000585" and the branch is about creating a license. "c61a6ef" is mentioned, likely representing a commit and it's 5 days ago. There are "6 Commits".
*   **File Listing:** The file list includes:
    *   `_pycache_` (likely a Python cache directory)
    *   `venv` (likely a Python virtual environment directory)
    *   `Dockerfile`
    *   `LICENSE`
    *   `MIT LICENSE`
    *   `app.py`
    *   `requirements.txt`
    *   `test.txt`
*   **File Actions and Timestamps:** The descriptions of the file actions include:
    *   "Final Submission"
    *   "First submission"
    *   "Create LICENSE"
    *   "Rename LICENSE to MIT LICENSE"
*   **Timestamps:** Most files were submitted "2 months ago," except for the "LICENSE" which was created "5 days ago".
*   **Implied Purpose:** This repository is likely for a software project, indicated by the Python virtual environment and related files like `app.py` and `requirements.txt`. The inclusion of a license file ("LICENSE" and then "MIT LICENSE") suggests the project is being prepared for public distribution.
