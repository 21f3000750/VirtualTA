Good Morning Sir,


This is my github repo: 
GitHub - kohliaryan/TDS_Project_1
 ()You can verify that it is public, MIT License is present and Dockerfile is also present.)


I also got a mail 2 days ago in which everything is mentioned correctly but the mail I got yesterday worry me.  Sir, I have worked really hard for project 1. Please look into this matter.

**Image Description:** The image appears to be an email or a document communicating the requirements and evaluation results for a project, likely a programming project.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

**Content:**

*   **Greeting:** "Dear Learner," indicates this is addressed to a student or someone learning.
*   **Project 1 Requirements:** The email lists the prerequisites for a project (Project 1). These are numbered 1 through 5. They involve a GitHub repository, a LICENSE file, a Dockerfile, and a Docker image.
*   **GitHub Requirements:**
    *   The repository must exist and be publicly accessible.
    *   It must contain a LICENSE file with an MIT license.
    *   It must contain a valid Dockerfile.
*   **Docker Image Requirements:**
    *   The Docker image must be publicly accessible.
    *   The image should be runnable using a `podman run` command with some environment variables and port mapping.
    *   The Docker image should use the same Dockerfile found in the GitHub repository.
*   **Consequence of Failure:** It clearly states that failing to meet these requirements will result in the submission not being evaluated.
*   **Prerequisite Evaluations:** A table-like format lists the evaluation results for some of the prerequisites.
    *   "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS" indicates this requirement has been met.
    *   "Is Github repo present AND public: FAIL" indicates a failure.
    *   "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL" indicates a failure.
    *   "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL" indicates a failure.

**Relevant Features:**

*   **Text Style:** The text is clean and easy to read.
*   **Hyperlink:** The "TDS Project 1: Evaluation" is a hyperlink (presumably to more detailed instructions).
*   **Code-like snippets:** The `podman run` command and the variable `$IMAGE_NAME` suggest a technical context, likely involving Docker and containerization.

**Overall, the image is a status report or feedback for a coding project that requires a GitHub repository with specific components and a Docker image.** The "FAIL" status indicates that the submission did not meet the requirements for several of the checks.

**Image Description:** The image is a text document, likely an email or an announcement, addressed to a "Dear Learner". It concerns the evaluation of a "project 1 docker image submission".

Here's a breakdown of the content:

*   **Introduction:** The document starts by informing the recipient that their docker image submission has been evaluated. It asks the learner to find certain files and explains what "MISSING" indicates (the evaluation didn't run or the image was misconfigured). It also states that missing files result in a score of 0.
*   **Performance Expectations:** It mentions that the docker image should become responsive within 5 minutes of launch. It clarifies that the server performance wasn't a bottleneck and that each image was tested with 1 Gigabit of dedicated network bandwidth.
*   **File List and Descriptions:** The document provides a numbered list of files related to the evaluation:
    1.  **Evaluation log file:** Link to a Google Drive file. This contains the performance report on individual tasks.
    2.  **Docker log file:** Link to a Google Drive file. This provides the technical performance of the container.
    3.  **Server start log file:** (See attachment). Logs for arm vs x86.
    4.  **Evaluation script file:** (See attachment). Logs for arm vs x86. This file contains the tests run against the submission.
    5.  **Data generation file:** (See attachment). The evaluation file depends on this file.
    6.  **Docker orchestration file:** (See attachment). This file handles retrieving the docker image from docker hub and launching the container, and sets up environment variables and port mappings.
    7.  **Solution script:** (See attachment zip). This script solves the project using prompt engineering as an example.
*   **Docker Image ID:** It identifies the docker image ID that was evaluated: "4829914856b".
*   **Scoring and Feedback:** It clarifies that the scores are preliminary. It encourages the learner to report bugs or discrepancies. It specifies a deadline (Tuesday) for reporting issues. It also mentions that the highest scores (including a sample script) will be used to normalize the rest of the scores. Finally, it offers to listen to feedback and apologize for any delays.
*   **Call to action:** The document encourages learners to post their concerns on the discourse thread.

In summary, this is an assessment report of a docker image project, informing the recipient about the evaluation process, files, performance criteria, and scoring. It also provides guidelines for seeking feedback and raising concerns.

Apologies for that,


The second email was an automated script that used a stricter criteria. You have passed evaluation and also have a score. So dont worry. We will push scores over this weekend. We are currently doing normalisation.


Kind regards

Hi 
@carlton
,


I’m experiencing the same issue mentioned in this thread regarding Project 1 evaluation emails:




The first email I received confirmed all requirements were met (public repo, MIT License, Dockerfile, etc.)


The second email incorrectly flagged missing files despite their presence in my repository




Here are screenshots of both emails showing the discrepancy:


First Evaluation Email
1511×724 76.2 KB


Second Evaluation Email
1247×681 37.5 KB


My GitHub repo remains publicly accessible with all required components:


GitHub repo


Could you please confirm this was an automated error and that my submission will be evaluated based on the actual repository contents? Your clarification would be greatly appreciated.


Thank you for your time and assistance!

Hi,


Prerequisite checks have passed. But your docker image was missing a dependency that you forgot to copy into the image. so it failed to evaluate because it failed to run.

Your Dockerfile was misconfigured. When we try to build the docker image from your github repo, we get this error:


tried copying parent folder(COPY failed: forbidden path outside the build context: .. ())


You have to replicate the test environment. If it works when you follow this test setup then you should get in touch with us.

    To replicate the test environment: 
Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can  run this code using uv.

**Image Description:** The image displays a terminal output of a Docker build and run process.  Let's break down the content:

**Docker Build Process (Top Section):**

*   **Progress Indicators:** The output traces a Docker build, with lines starting with `=>` indicating various build steps. Each line usually starts with `sha256:` followed by a hexadecimal string, representing the Docker image layer.
*   **Extracting & Downloading:** Several lines indicate the extraction of layers from previously cached or downloaded images (e.g., "extracting sha256"). The size of the image layer is also shown.
*   **Build Stages:** The build process progresses through defined stages, such as:
    *   `[internal] load build context` (loading the build context files)
    *   `[2/5] WORKDIR /app` (setting the working directory)
    *   `[3/5] COPY /app` (copying files)
    *   `[4/5] COPY requirements.txt /app/` (copying a file)
    *   `[5/5] RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt` (executing a command, installing Python dependencies)
*   **Image Exporting:** The final stages involve exporting the built image:
    *   `exporting to image`
    *   `exporting layers`
    *   `exporting manifest...` (various manifests being created)
    *   `naming to docker.io/library/sha256:....` (tagging the image)
    *   `unpacking to docker.io/library/sha256....`
*   **Timestamps:** Rightmost column of the first section contains timestamps showing how long the actions in the line take, these are in the format of `0.0s, 0.1s, 5.1s` etc.

**Docker Run Command & Server Startup (Bottom Section):**

*   **`View build details:`** Line directs to where build details are
*   **`C:\SSNFun\IITM\sudhishssn134-project_1_tds-b240fec>docker run...`**: This is the command used to run the Docker image.  Let's break it down:
    *   `docker run`: This is the Docker command to launch a container from an image.
    *   `-e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN`:  Sets an environment variable named `AIPROXY_TOKEN` inside the container, using the value of the corresponding environment variable on the host machine.
    *   `-p 8000:8000`:  Publishes port 8000 of the container to port 8000 on the host machine. This means the application running inside the container will be accessible on the host at `localhost:8000`.
    *   `sha256:9739a6...`: This is the image ID (or a short form of it) of the Docker image to run.
*   **Server Startup Output:** The last part of the terminal output shows what appears to be a server running within the container.
    *   `INFO: Started server process [1]`
    *   `INFO: Waiting for application startup.`
    *   `INFO: Application startup complete.`
    *   `INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000...` - The server is running. Uvicorn, a fast ASGI server, is serving an application.
    *   `(Press CTRL+C to quit)` - How to stop the server.

**Overall, the image is showing the building and running of a Dockerized Python application. It builds an image, likely installs python packages, sets up an environment variable, and publishes a port for access. The process is then followed by the application starting and running in a container.**

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/f/5f58734cfd90a7011b3effca56b9023d51b773c0.png)

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall:**

The image is a console output, likely showing the build process of a Docker image followed by the execution of a Docker container. The output is rich with information about the steps involved, image layers, and environment setup.

**Main Sections:**

1.  **Docker Image Build Process:**
    *   The image clearly demonstrates a Docker build process.  The output details various steps, including:
        *   Downloading and extracting base layers, as indicated by the lines starting with "=> => sha256:..." followed by "extracting".
        *   Loading the build context.
        *   Setting the working directory (`WORKDIR /app`).
        *   Copying files (`COPY ./app`, `COPY requirements.txt /app/`).
        *   Running commands within the image during the build (`RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`).
        *   Exporting the image to layers and manifest files.
    *   Timestamps are provided for each step, allowing to understand the duration of each step, most steps finished under 1 second, and some takes a few seconds.
    *   Sha256 hashes are associated with image layers, which are used for caching and efficiently building the image.

2.  **Docker Run Command and Environment Variables:**
    *   The line "C:\SSNFun\IITM...". docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY\_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 sha256:9739a6..." shows the command used to run the Docker container.
    *   The command uses a custom token (AIPROXY_TOKEN) passed to the container via environment variables.
    *   Port mapping is set up (`-p 8000:8000`), which means the container's port 8000 is exposed to the host machine on port 8000.
    *   The image being run is identified by its SHA256 hash: sha256:9739a607cecceea347fade8e485cb7c372b86608284aaa852144ebb755586649.

3.  **Container Startup and Application Information:**
    *   The "INFO:" lines provide details on the application's startup.  These lines indicate that a server process has started and is waiting for application startup.
    *   The application startup completes successfully.
    *   Uvicorn, a Python ASGI server, is running on port 8000.

**Additional Details and Observations:**

*   The build process appears to be based on a Python application, as `pip install` is involved.
*   The output format is typical of Docker builds, providing a lot of information.
*   The image provides detailed information about the build, including timestamps, and which layers have been created.
*   The Docker image is executed with an environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN`, which will be important for the container's operation.
*   The Docker container exposes port 8000.
*   The application uses Uvicorn, indicating an async Python framework such as FastAPI or similar.
*   It seems this image is built on a Windows machine.

**In Conclusion:**

The image is a comprehensive log of a Docker image build and container execution. It shows the key steps in the build process, the command used to run the container (including environment variables and port mapping), and confirmation of the application's successful startup on port 8000.

URGENT ATTN REQ: technical discrepancy and inconsistency in the evaluation scripts of graded assignment and project 2
 
Tools in Data Science





    Project 1 : You tried to copy parent folder(Ref:line number 8 in your 
Dockerfile
) but there is no parent folder with respect to github repo’s root folder, so it fails evaluation. 
Project 2 : Response we received through google form was 
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
 which is local host url not a vercel endpoint.
