 No that will not be possible. It will go live only at 1 pm.

## Post #5 by bhashwar_sengupta (Post ID: 601588)
Got it. Thank you. Also, are there any standard set of instructions that we need to follow during the ROE, like in OPPEs?

---

## Post #7 by Yogesh1 (Post ID: 601648)
Is it 45 minutes long?

## Post #8 by 23f2004837 (Post ID: 601788)
No, it is 45 minutes ‘short’

## Post #9 by 23f2004636 (Post ID: 601833)
@carlton
 will exam take place on the IITM Exam Portal (like other JAVA, Python OPPE) or will it take place on the TDS course portal like we had for Weekly GA?

Hello 
@carlton
 sir, I could only find one live session of ROE in youtube. Can you please point out where are the other recordings?

---

## Post #11 by carlton (Post ID: 601950)
All week 7 sessions are ROE mock solving questions. Only the 4th session was a special session and was labelled as such, but it also has a mock solving component. These are all available on the Youtube channel

**Image Description:** Here is a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a webpage. It is likely related to exams or academic schedules, given the prominent mention of "Exam" and date/timing details. The page shows a table with exam information, and there are also some navigation elements and banner text at the top.

**Header and Banner:**

*   The top of the webpage displays a logo and the name "IIT Madras."
*   There are several navigational elements.
*   A red banner announces: "Applications Open now for May 2025 Batch | Applications Close: May 20, 2025 | Exam: July 13, 2025 APPLY NOW."

**Main Content (Table):**

*   The core of the page is a table that presents exam-related information. The table has the following columns:
    *   "COURSE NAME": lists the course names: "Python A1 (P1 to P64)," "Python A2 (P65 to P128)," and "Java."
    *   "TIMING": indicates the exam times. The timings are as follows:
        *   "Python A1": 09:30 AM to 11:30 AM
        *   "Python A2": 09:30 AM to 11:30 AM
        *   "Java": 09:30 AM to 11:00 AM
    *   "EXAM LINK": provides the URL to access the exam (links are provided for each course).
*   The table is titled "Date: March 02nd 2025".
*   The table has a light blue background.
*   Below the table are some "Important Links for OPPE."

**Other Elements:**

*   A taskbar at the bottom of the screen shows the date (02-03-2025) and time (12:11) along with other information.

**Overall Impression:**

The webpage is organized to display exam schedules, providing course names, timings, and links to access the exams. The site is likely a resource for students at IIT Madras.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Structure:**

The image is a table-like structure, likely a schedule or a list of exams or online sessions. It has a title "Date: March 02nd 2025" and several rows and columns.  It also contains a few additional notes at the bottom.

**Table Content:**

*   **Header Row:**
    *   `COURSE NAME`
    *   `TIMING`
    *   `EXAM LINK`

*   **Rows (Course Listings):**
    *   **Row 1:** Course Name: `Python A1 (P1 to P64)`; Timing: `09:30 AM to 11:30 AM`; Exam Link: `CLOSED`
    *   **Row 2:** Course Name: `Python A2 (P65 to P128)`; Timing: `09:30 AM to 11:30 AM`; Exam Link: `CLOSED`

    *   `Seeya is now integrated with google chrome & it will work only in Updated version of chrome.`

**Key Features & Possible Uses:**

*   **Schedule:** The image presents a schedule with course names, timing, and exam links.
*   **Online Exams/Sessions:** The "EXAM LINK" column suggests these are related to online exams or interactive sessions.
*   **Course Specifics:** The format P1 to P64 and P65 to P128 suggest different groups of people in a class and the java course, maybe there are several classes.
*   **Date:** The date, March 2nd 2025, clarifies the timeframe this schedule relates to.
*   **Timezone:** The timing is in the Indian Standard Time (IST).
*   **Software/Compatibility:** The information about "Seeya" integrating with Google Chrome implies the use of specific software for accessing the exams/sessions, and that Chrome is the recommended environment.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall:**

The image appears to be a webpage displaying an error message alongside troubleshooting tips. The background is a dark gray color.

**Text Elements:**

*   **Title/Header:** "Trouble seeing questions?" is written in bold, likely a header.
*   **Troubleshooting Steps (numbered list):**
    1.  "Try with Chrome or Edge. This site needs a modern, not-too-privacy-sensitive browser."
    2.  "Disable ad or cookie blockers. This site uses third-party cookies for authentication."

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Scene:**

*   The image shows a tabby cat lying on top of a laptop. The setting appears to be indoors, possibly a home, with soft lighting.

**Main Subject:**

*   **The Cat:** A medium-sized tabby cat is the clear focal point. It has a light grey and brown striped coat. Its eyes are a light green color, and the cat is looking intently at the laptop screen. Its paws are extended, resting on the keyboard.
*   **The Laptop:** The cat is positioned on a laptop. The laptop is open. We can see parts of the keyboard. The brand is visible, though only the "VAIO" logo is distinguishable, indicating a Sony laptop.
*   **Mouse:** A red, wired computer mouse is placed to the left of the laptop.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Background:** The background is somewhat blurred, but it appears to be a couch or bed covering, with a warm, possibly wooden, surface.
*   **Lighting:** The image has a warm, indoor lighting scheme.
*   **Composition:** The image is a close-up, focusing primarily on the cat and the laptop. The camera angle is a little above the subjects.

**Objects and Features for Questioning:**

*   **Cat's Breed/Age/Gender:** The tabby pattern can help identify the type of cat. The size can help to identify age (adult or young).
*   **Laptop Model/Specifications:** The VAIO logo suggests a certain brand of laptop. Questions could focus on the age or purpose of the laptop (work or recreation).
*   **Purpose/Context:** The image suggests a humorous interaction, possibly showing a cat interfering with computer use. Questions can be asked regarding the setting of this picture.

@Saransh_Saini
   Sir, can you please tell me why this was not accepted? here is my code:


from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import httpx
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

# Add CORS middleware to handle preflight OPTIONS requests
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

@app.get("/api")
async def proxy(url: str, request: Request):
    headers = {key: value for key, value in request.headers.items() if key.lower() != "host"}
    try:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(url, headers=headers)
            return response.text
    except httpx.RequestError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Request failed: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)



here are the responses:

INFO:     127.0.0.1:51793 - "GET /api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhttpbin.org%2Fget%3Fx%3D87738 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK

**Image Description:** The image is a screenshot of a coding environment, likely for a software engineering task. It is split into two main sections: a web browser window and a "Thunder Client" interface. 

**Web Browser Window (Left):**

*   **Web Page:** The browser displays a webpage with a dark theme and a green header that says "exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-roefhq-stackoverflow.commo...".
*   **Exam/Task Section:** The page presents an exam or coding task. It has a score of "0/10" and options to "Check all" and "Save."
*   **Exam Question:** There's a question labeled "5" that asks the user to "Write a FastAPI proxy server (1 mark)." The question's instructions specify that the server should fetch data from a given URL and add a CORS header (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`) to the response.
*   **Example and Input:** The question gives an example API URL and explains how to test.
*   **Error:** It shows a prompt asking "What is your FastAPI Proxy URL endpoint?" and the current answer is "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api" marked with "Error: Incorrect response."
*   **Instructions:** Additional instructions advise testing the response with a specific URL, and the expected data match.

**Thunder Client Interface (Right):**

*   **Purpose:** This section is a testing tool, likely for making HTTP requests. It's similar to Postman or Insomnia.
*   **Interface:**
    *   "New Request" button in the top left corner.
    *   "GET" method selected.
    *   URL Field: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F%3F...`.
    *   Tabs for "Query", "Headers", "Auth", "Body", "Tests", "Pre Run".
*   **Activity:** The left pane of the Thunder Client shows a list of past API requests.
*   **Response Section:** Displays the response of the last request. The response has the status code 200 OK and shows HTML content with a heading 'Example Domain".
*   **Terminal:** A terminal/output window below the response displays the output of the request in terminal format. It shows a series of "INFO" lines regarding requests and responses.

**Overall:**

The image depicts a developer attempting to solve a coding challenge or exam question involving creating a proxy server using FastAPI, and using a tool to test the functionality. The error in the response suggests the server isn't returning the expected data or CORS headers correctly.

ROE was challenging, but definitely Mocks helped a lot. I think mocks were the best preparation for ROE. Did good because of it.

## Post #56 by Saransh_Saini (Post ID: 602216)
Your answer is absolutely correct 
@23f2000573

But the problem is you had to submit the answer rounded off to 3 decimal places. A decimal more or less would result in a wrong answer.

Hello Sir"s, 
@carlton
 
@Saransh_Saini


I was able to successfully attempt only 5 questions within the time limit. But due to internet issues, I could not submit exactly at 1:45pm.

My last submission was at 1:47pm. But if there was a auto save then you could already check my answers were in the portal.


I request you to please consider submission delays of 2-3 mins as this was due a technical glitches. And we too are switching tabs and running in vscode




Kind Regards,

Muthu

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

The image displays a small section of a webpage or application interface. It seems to be related to a "Recent saves" section.

**Text and Visual Elements:**

*   **Title:** "Recent saves" appears in a dark green font. It is clear and bold, indicating it is a header.
*   **Additional Text:** "(most recent is your..." follows the title, though the sentence is cut off.
*   **Button:** A blue button labeled "Reload" is visible. It's in a rectangular shape with rounded corners, typical of interactive buttons. The "Reload" text is in a light blue font.
*   **Timestamp:** "from 3/2/2025, 1:47:43 PM. S" appears next to the button. This indicates the date and time of the most recent save.
*   **Background:** The background of the image is a light, pale green.

**Functionality and Context:**

The presence of the "Reload" button suggests the option to refresh or retrieve the latest saved state. The timestamp is for March 2, 2025, at 1:47:43 PM, indicating when the last save occurred. The section is most likely showing the user the recent state of their progress on a project or a document that is being worked on.

Hello  
@carlton


@Jivraj
 
@Saransh_Saini
 as I already showed you in the meet that while submitting it was already showing 10, and for surety and safety i clicked on SAVE Button, on resaving now it’s showing 0 and dint get submitted properly…


As you can see from your records, I have already finished and submitted everything correctly. This carries a lot of weight and will significantly impact my grade, therefore I kindly ask that you take this into account and give me full marks. So i beg you sir for considering my request sir, also attaching the screenshot as you instructed in the meet for your reference sir.

Hello 
@carlton
 / 
@Saransh_Saini


I tried submitting my exam at 3:14 AM EST, but my browser reloaded unexpectedly. I ended up re-entering my answers and submitted at 3:15:46 AM. I had completed eight questions (8 marks) well before the time, but got stuck on the last two.

I understand I should have submitted more frequently, but those final 5 minutes flew by like the fastest 5 minutes of my life.


Please consider accepting my submission


Thanks so much and best regards,

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image seems to display a user interface, likely related to an online application or platform. It shows a user's recent activity, login information, and some basic functionality. The design is clean, with a dark background and a clear focus on the information presented.

**Text & Features:**

1.  **Header:**

    *   "You are logged in as 22f1000535@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." This line indicates the user's logged-in account information, including a unique ID and the domain `ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. This likely points to an educational platform, possibly connected with the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM).
2.  **Logout Button:**

    *   A "Logout" button is displayed in a rectangular box with a red border.

3.  **"Recent saves" Section:**

    *   A green box displays information about the user's recent saves.
    *   The heading "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)" suggests this section is tracking progress.
    *   Two entries with the following format:
        *   A "Reload" button is displayed in a rectangular box with a blue border.
        *   "from 3/2/2025, 3:16:50 AM. Score: 8"
        *   "from 3/2/2025, 3:15:46 AM. Score: 8"
        *   The scores for both instances are 8.
    *   The use of the date 3/2/2025 implies that the image is showing a futuristic date, suggesting that this may be a mocked-up or test environment.

**Colors and Design:**

*   The background is a dark gray or black, providing a high-contrast look.
*   Text colors vary: white for most text, the title of the recent saved is green.
*   Boxes, especially those with interactive elements (logout, reload), are outlined in different colors.

**Possible Context:**

Based on the details, the image seems to be from an application or a platform likely designed for academic use. The use of the email address associated with IITM makes it possible the context is associated with an IITM course. It could be tracking the scores or progress of the user in a quiz, exam, or course. The “reload” buttons could refresh the score or the activity.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Structure:** The image shows a terminal window displaying the output of a Python script related to extracting tables from a PDF file. The terminal is likely running on a Linux or macOS system, based on the file paths.

**Textual Content:**

*   **Requirement Satisfaction:** The initial lines of the output show messages like "Requirement already satisfied," indicating that the necessary Python packages for a script have already been installed. The packages listed include `tabula-py`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `distro`, `python-dateutil`, `pytz`, `tzdata`, and `six`. These are common libraries used for data analysis and PDF processing.
*   **File Information:**
    *   The user has likely selected a PDF file named `q-extract-tam-pdf (2).pdf` and the output shows that this PDF is being processed.
    *   It mentions the file size (167477 bytes) and the last modified date (02/03/2025).
    *   The script is saving the extracted table to `q-extract-tables-from-pdf (2) (1).pdf`
*   **Warnings:** There are several "WARNING" messages related to fonts within the PDF. It mentions `org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.PDType1Font` and indicates that the script is using fallback fonts like `Liberationsans` because of issues with the original font.
*   **Extracted Table:** The primary content is the extracted data, likely a table from the PDF. The table has the following columns:
    *   Maths
    *   Physics
    *   English
    *   Economics
    *   Biology
    *   Group
    *   The table contains several rows of numeric data corresponding to these columns
*   **Data Types:**  The output also includes the data types for each column:
    *   Maths: int64
    *   Physics: int64
    *   English: int64
    *   Economics: int64
    *   Biology: int64
    *   Group: int64
    *   dtype: object
*   **Additional Information:** The output includes the data type of the entire table (`dtype: object`) and a numerical value `34919`.

**Objects and Features:**

*   **Terminal Window:** The main visual element is the terminal window. This is indicated by the text-based interface, the command prompt at the top (`Choose files`), the output of commands and the use of color for formatting some parts of the text.
*   **File Names and Paths:** File names like `q-extract-tables-from-pdf (2).pdf` and file paths like `/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages` give clues about the type of operation being performed and the operating system environment.
*   **Tabular Data:** The organized presentation of numerical data in rows and columns indicates that the script's function is to extract tabular information from a document.
*   **Warnings:** The warning messages suggest potential problems with the font rendering or document structure that the PDF library is dealing with.

**In Summary:**  The image captures the output of a Python script that extracts and parses tables from a PDF document, likely a report or some kind of data table. The script uses libraries like `tabula-py` and `pandas`. The warning messages highlight potential font issues within the PDF that were automatically addressed by the script.

**Image Description:** The image displays a quiz question and an incorrect answer. The question asks: "What is the total Biology marks of students who scored 30 or more marks in Maths in groups 1-28 (including both groups)?"

The user's answer, "34919", is shown within a red-bordered input field, along with an exclamation mark indicating an error. Below the answer, "Incorrect. Try again." is displayed.

**Image Description:** The image is a screenshot of a web page, likely a coding assessment or a similar online learning environment. Here's a breakdown:

**Top Section:**

*   **Timer:** "00:19:29 left" indicates the remaining time to complete the assessment.
*   **Score:** "Score: 10/10" shows the user's current score, suggesting they've completed the assessment successfully.
*   **Buttons:** "Check all" and "Save" are buttons for submitting the work.
*   **Notifications:** There are messages about resources, like joining a "Discourse" forum and a Google Meet for technical issues, both specifically for IITM students.

**Middle Section:**

*   **User Information:**  It displays "You are logged in as 21f2000588@ds.study.iitm.ac.in.", indicating the user's account. The domain "ds.study.iitm.ac.in"  suggests it's a platform used at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM).
*   **Logout Button:**  A red "Logout" button allows the user to log out of their account.

**"Recent Saves" Section:**

*   This section shows the user's save history. Each entry includes a timestamp, "Score," and a "Reload" button to restore a previous version. This demonstrates the user's progress over time.

**"Questions" Section:**

*   The first question in a coding assessment is displayed: "Write a FastAPI proxy server (1 mark)." This indicates that the assessment involves coding using the FastAPI framework.

In summary, the image is a snapshot of an online learning or assessment platform, most likely used for coding assignments, and likely hosted by IITM, with a focus on the ongoing assessment or testing process.

Hello

@Saransh_Saini


I  am Gudivada Abiram(21f3002158). In my today’s ROE exam I forgot to click the save button. My score initially was 6/10. I was tackling another question and by that time the timer went off. I can even send my answers if required.

I should have submitted more frequently, but I was busy solving the other questions for extra marks.

Could you please consider my request?

Thank you.

**Image Description:** The image shows a webpage, likely related to an exam or test.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Webpage Title/URL:** The top of the page indicates the URL is "exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-roe".
*   **Header:** There is a red header that says "Ended at Sun, 2 Mar, 2025, 1:45 pm IST". It also shows a score of "0".
*   **Content Body:**
    *   It contains a section titled "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)". This suggests that the user had saved the exam content at multiple times.
    *   Each save entry displays a "Reload" button, the date and time (3/2/2025, 1:41:37 PM, 1:41:37 PM and 1:41:33 PM), and a score of "10".

Hi 
@21f3002158


I looked for your result in backend, seems like you didn’t click to submit button throughout the exam.


Since roe exam portal was similar to GA’s where you need to save answers using save button, after saving only your answers get evaluated and you get answers.


There is no way other than pressing save button, we can’t do any help with this.

 sir,  I got disconnected at around 1:35 due to a network glitch and had to restart my uv server as well collab which wasted around 5 min and my score was around 7 and further I ran multiple scripts which I had already saved as code snippets as part of GA for question 4 on vs code and Collab and  finally got the answer but I exceeded the time limit since the submission I made was at 1:47:28 which was 9…so I request to please consider that

Overall the ROE was a great experience and I wholly enjoyed the process


Thank you for giving us this amazing opportunity

The questions were really similar to the GAs and mocks…I practiced them beforehand and had code snippets ready to use…so I guess that was helpful

## Post #80 by 24f2003130 (Post ID: 602982)
Ok sir

Also I have realised the value of 28 seconds since my last submission (9/10) was at 1:47:28

I respect the rules of the exam and will be more careful in the future exams to avoid such technical glitches.


Thank you

When I clicked the save button, it took an unusually long time to respond and eventually showed an error. There was no network issue, as other applications were working fine. However, the moment I clicked “Save,” all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive. I’m not sure what caused this problem, but I will share a screenshot to help diagnose the issue.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Structure:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of an online exam or quiz interface. The layout is a dark theme with a green top bar. The content is related to a statistics question.

**Top Bar:**

*   **Timer:** The top-left corner displays a timer that reads "00:04:19 left," indicating the remaining time for the task.
*   **Score:** The top-left corner also displays the current score, "Score: 1/10."
*   **Save Button:** The top-right corner has a green "Save" button, likely to save progress.
*   **Dropdown Icon:** In the top-right corner, there is an icon indicating a dropdown menu.

**Question Area:**

*   **Question:** The main area contains a question about the Pearson correlation coefficient: "What is the Pearson correlation coefficient between columns A and B?"
*   **Input Field:** Below the question, there is a text input field where the user is supposed to enter the answer. The text field has a red border, suggesting a potential issue.
*   **Instructions:**  Additional instructions are provided: "Calculate the sample correlation coefficient using Python, Excel, or JavaScript. The data doesn't have any missing values. Write the answer rounded to 3 decimal places, e.g. -0.769."
*   **Check Button:** A "Check" button is present, presumably to submit the answer and check it.
*   **Checking...**: While the answer is not yet checked, a line of text says "Checking..." appears.

**Error Message:**

*   **Error Box:**  A large red box appears at the bottom, indicating an error.
*   **Error Text:** The error message is "Error! Failed to fetch. Please contact the exam team for assistance."

**Other Features:**

*   **Save Button:**  A green "Save" button is present, as well as the one at the top.
*   **Footer Text:** "Save regularly. Your last saved submission will be evaluated." is at the bottom of the page.

**In Summary:**

The image showcases an online exam environment, where the user is trying to answer a statistics question. An error ("Failed to fetch") is preventing the user from submitting the answer. The layout includes a timer, score indicator, "Save" buttons, the question, an input field for the answer, instructions, a "Check" button, and an error message.

Hi 
@23f2004781


I looked for your submissions in backend and can’t find any submission.








 23f2004781:




There was no network issue, as other applications were working fine. However, the moment I clicked “Save,” all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive.






There was a technical support meeting going between 1 Pm to 1:50 pm on ROE day, you were expected to join that meeting. You didn’t join technical support meet before deadline.

1130×240 10.2 KB


Even on discourse we were continuously looking for new posts during ROE, you created discourse post at 2:3 PM which was after deadline so we can’t help with it.

### Image Insight:
![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/c/ccfb997e8fdbdab7596c4f36e6a0457f515a7cc8.png)

**Image Description:** Here's a breakdown of the image:

**Visual Elements:**

*   **Background:** The background is a dark, muted gray color.
*   **Rectangle:** A turquoise-bordered rectangle is centered within the image. This acts as a visual container for the text and icon.
*   **Icon:** A speech bubble icon, in white, is in the upper left corner. It has horizontal lines within it, representing text.
*   **Text:** The content within the rectangle is the main focus. The text is written in white.

**Textual Content:**

*   "Have questions? Join Discourse (IITM students only)" - This line suggests a way for viewers to ask questions using the Discourse platform, limited to students of IITM.
*   "Techical issues? OPTIONAL: Join Google Meet (IITM students only)" - This line offers an optional way to address technical issues by joining a Google Meet session, also limited to IITM students.

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be a call to action or a form of user support. It provides guidance on how to seek help, differentiating between general questions (Discourse) and technical issues (Google Meet). The inclusion of "(IITM students only)" suggests the content is geared towards a specific audience, probably students of the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM).

I have attempted all the questions in the ROE and solved few of the questions but i forgot to save the submission. At that time, I did not realize that I have not even saved once during the time. After realizing that i have not saved it in the evening, I have used the console to disable the save and saved my answers. Is it possible to validate it? I don’t have any submissions before 1:45pm. I realize that it is my mistake for not being careful about it but i request sir to be lenient about it as the project 1 was also difficult and i have my exams tomorrow.

Hi 
@Jayeshbansal


Until not clicked on save button answers get’s checked at frontend side only. There is no way we can validate it after deadline.


I trust you would have solved few questions and also would have checked before deadline but clicking on save button was must to get submission evaluated.


Kind regards

## Post #88 by Jayeshbansal (Post ID: 602991)
i have not saved even once during the deadline but i have submitted/saved by hacking it in the evening when i realised that i have not saved it, i am asking you to consider that as i really don’t have any saves before deadline which will result me 0 marks, my request is to accept post deadline save by being lenient about it else i will get 0 marks. I will be satisfied even if you consider my 2nd save rather than latest save. (1st save was a sample test to check if possible, so it was 0 marks but the 2nd save is under 1-2 min which may prove that i have done all that questions before)

Hello sir, 
@Jivraj

Do you mean you will not consider them for evaluation then?

---

## Post #91 by Jivraj (Post ID: 603009)
Yes, it won’t be considered.

---

## Post #92 by Jayeshbansal (Post ID: 603011)
yes, as you can see my first save is at 7:25 which was a trial check if post submission is working or not but you can see that the 2nd and 3rd are saved in approx 1 minute but i got 8 corrects which proves that i have done it before only. the latest save got 9 marks as i forgot to run the fastapi server for 1st mark which resulted me 3 more minutes. So, I request sir to consider any one of the saves except the first save

---

## Post #93 by Jivraj (Post ID: 603014)
Sorry 
@Jayeshbansal
 All your submissions were around 7 hours after 1:47:00 Pm, that’s why we won’t consider them for evaluation.


Kind regards

Hi 
@23f3002537

The problem is that, here you are sending headers unnecessary and overwriting the original headers. Moreover you were returning the text of the response instead of the json. Here is the revised version.


from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import httpx
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

# Add CORS middleware to handle preflight OPTIONS requests
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

@app.get("/api")
async def proxy(url: str, request: Request):
    headers = {key: value for key, value in request.headers.items() if key.lower() != "host"}
    try:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(url)
            return response.json()
    except httpx.RequestError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Request failed: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)

## Post #95 by Muthupalaniappan (Post ID: 603027)
Hello 
@Jivraj
 sir,


Will it be possible to consider only the minutes. I also cannot control the technical delays. I raised the point as fast as possible and I also joined the technical GMEET and exited when a different person raised the same question.


I would dearly propose to consider still 1:47. But if it’s 1:48 you can ofcourse not consider it. But the “seconds” is something unrealistic.


Please re consider this request sir.

## Post #99 by Saransh_Saini (Post ID: 603125)
I checked your submission, its at 1:47:30 PM. We are going to give a grace period of 2 minutes past 1:45 PM. Given that you submitted 30 seconds past 1:47, we won’t be able to consider it.

Regards

---

## Post #100 by Yogesh1 (Post ID: 603134)
Please reconsider this decision. In the heat of the moment, I failed to save. In my mind, I was sure that I had saved it. There is one other student with the same problem ( saved a few seconds after 1:47).


Since I did only one save, I would get zero marks if the score is not considered.


I didn’t submit any new answer after 1:45 pm.


Please reconsider if possible.

Dont worry, we have the right scores on our server. There has been some problem in sending the export to the operations team. Your scores are safe. We are working on figuring out the problem. Even the bonus marks are recorded. Just give us a couple of days to sort it out. Many students have been affected so we cant give individual responses right now. Its a system fix that needs to be implemented.

## Post #120 by Haricharan (Post ID: 604761)
Respected Sir,


I noticed that my status is still marked as absent. I understand I may be a bit impatient, but I wanted to clarify my submission. I had submitted the ROE on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed until 1:47 PM.


Even after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term’s project was tougher than the last.


Even if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it’s my mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form. Since this is a standalone degree for me, I’m actually worried about it. When I learned how to unlock the ROE, I completed it in a very short time.


Please consider the top marks even when did after the normal deadline as marks still got submitted

The latest submission before the deadline would be 3 marks. That is what would be considered.

**Image Description:** The image displays a table with three columns and two rows of data.

**Column 1:** Contains email addresses. Both rows have the same email address: "23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in".

**Column 2:** Contains timestamps in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS". The first row shows "2025-03-02 17:51:08", and the second row shows "2025-03-02 13:45:05".

**Column 3:** Contains numerical values. The first row has the value "4", and the second row has the value "3".

The table appears to be a log or a record of some kind, potentially related to the email address and timestamp information.
