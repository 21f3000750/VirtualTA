**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Layout and Structure:**

*   The image appears to be a screenshot or a section of a webpage or online course platform.
*   There is a top section that seems to be a banner or header.
*   The body of the image contains a list of assignments and quizzes, possibly a grade report or progress tracker for a course.

**Header Section:**

*   **Text:** "Tools in Data Science" is the largest text, presumably the name of the course. Below it is "NEW COURSE," likely indicating it's a newly offered course.
*   **Background:** The background of the header is a gradient of dark red/brown with small, slightly lighter circles scattered across it, creating a dotted effect.

**Body Section:**

*   **Content:** The main content is a list of assignments and quizzes. Each item includes the assignment/quiz name, its corresponding week or title, and potentially its grade.
    *   "Week 1 Assignment - 80.00"
    *   "Week 2 Assignment - 65.00"
    *   "Week 3 Assignment - 21.10"
    *   "Week 4 Assignment - 20.00"
    *   "Week 5 Assignment - 90.00"
    *   "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 - Absent"
*   **Format:** The list is structured, likely a table or a list of entries.

**Overall Impression:**

The image displays a student's performance in an online data science course. It provides a snapshot of assignment scores and quiz results. The inclusion of "Absent" next to the quiz suggests attendance tracking.

Dear Sir,


I would like to bring this to your attention that even though I submitted the ROE multiple times, the dashboard is showing absent.


I hope the issue will be resolved at earliest as I am not the only one facing this issue

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a webpage or application interface. It's divided into sections related to user login information and saved data.

**Top Section:**

*   **Text:** "You are logged in as 23f3004246@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." This indicates the user is logged in with the provided email address.
*   **Button:** A red "Logout" button is present, presumably for logging out of the current session.

**Bottom Section:**

*   **Title:** "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)" This suggests the section is displaying previous saved data.
*   **Saved Data Entries:** Three entries are displayed, each with the following format:
    *   "Reload" button (presumably to restore that save).
    *   Date and time: "from 3/2/2025, 1:44:11 PM." (and subsequent times for other saves.)
    *   Score: "Score: 6" (and decreasing scores for prior saves).

**Style and Design:**

*   The interface is clean, with a light background and clear text.
*   The "Recent saves" section uses a light green background to group the information.
*   The overall design appears to be functional and user-friendly.

**Inferences:**

*   This is likely a system where users can save their progress and see their scores over time.
*   The most recent score is indicated as the official score.
*   The dates and times of the saves suggest a progression of attempts at something.

Hi 
@carlton
 
@Jivraj
 sir,


I wanted to bring to your attention that, although as you are already aware that I was present for the ROE and successfully submitted my exam, my dashboard currently reflects my status as “Absent.”


I have attached a screenshot for your reference. I assume this might be a backend issue or that the scores are still being updated. Could you kindly look into this and confirm?


Thank you

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Structure:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a webpage or an interface element. It's divided into two main sections: a top banner with a title and some content section below.

**Top Banner:**

*   **Color Scheme:** The top part has a deep red/burgundy background with a subtle gradient or visual effect, possibly with small dots or a texture pattern.
*   **Text:**  
    *   "Tools in Data Science" -  Large, white text, presumably the title of a course.
    *   "NEW COURSE" -  Below the title, in a smaller font, indicating it's a recently launched course.

**Content Section (Below the Banner):**

*   **Background:**  A light gray or white background.
*   **Content:**  Displays a list of grades or scores.
    *   "Week 1 Assignment - 100.00"
    *   "Week 2 Assignment - 90.00"
    *   "Week 3 Assignment - 100.00"
    *   "Week 4 Assignment - 110.00"
    *   "Week 5 Assignment - 100.00"
    *   "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 - Absent" -  Indicates the student was absent for the first programming quiz.
*   **Button:** At the bottom of the content section, there is a button "Go to Course page >" in orange, with an arrow indicating the direction it goes to, suggesting this is a link to view the course details.

**Overall Interpretation:**

The image provides a snapshot of a student's performance in a "Tools in Data Science" course. It displays assignment scores for the first five weeks and a notation for a missed programming quiz. The presence of a "Go to Course page" button suggests that this is an interface related to a learning management system or a course platform.

    *   "Week 5 Assignment - 100.00"
*   **Quiz:** Information about a programming quiz. It states "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 - Absent", implying the student did not attend this quiz.

**Footer/Button:**

*   A button labeled "Go to Course page >" in a reddish-brown color. This presumably leads to the full course details.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Structure:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a web page or application interface. It's organized into a header section and a content section.

**Header Section:**

*   **Login Information:** At the top, the text "You are logged in as" is displayed, followed by the user's email address "23f2005141@ds.study.iitm.ac.in.". This suggests that a user is currently logged in.
*   **Logout Button:** Below the login information, there is a button labeled "Logout" in a red box. This button would likely allow the user to end their current session.

**Content Section (Recent Saves):**

*   **Title:** The section is titled "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)". This indicates that the section lists the user's recently saved progress or scores.
*   **Entries:** There are three entries listed, each including the following:
    *   **Reload Button:** A light-blue button labeled "Reload". This suggests the user can reload a previous state.
    *   **Timestamp:** The date and time of each save are displayed in the format "3/2/2025, 1:51:06 PM" , "3/2/2025, 1:46:11 PM" , and "3/2/2025, 1:45:33 PM".
    *   **Score:** Each entry includes the text "Score: 6".

**General Appearance:**

*   The background appears to be light-colored, with a green box encompassing the recent saves. The text is in a dark font.

**Possible Uses & Context:**

This image suggests a system for tracking user progress, probably in an online quiz or educational program. The "Score" and "Reload" buttons hint that this might be a platform where users can save and restore their progress to potentially improve scores. The timestamps are in the future which is either a bug in the date display or the time is set to an incorrect zone.

I feel I should atleast receive the marks for which I had submitted within the time limit.

We have not yet updated the scores for ROE (there are roughly 130 students affected by the previous update). So just wait till it gets pushed by operations (most likely Tuesday). I can assure you that we have the right scores on our server, there is just an issue when “transporting” those scores over to the operations team, which we have now rectified and since scores are batch processed it will happen over night during a server update.


Bottom line: wait till Tuesday

Both bonus and your actual roe scores will reflect on dashboard by then.

If not let us know


Kind regards.

Hi Team, I have appeared for ROE TDS 2025 and have secured 3 marks, but my score is shown as zero in the dashboard.


Please clarify.

### Image Insight:
![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/2/b/2b56299cd6d1e7c1ae549426fb08868d5a6befc7.png)

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Layout:**

The image presents a dashboard or a course overview page. It is divided into sections with a dark brown background and white text, indicating a website or application interface.

**Header:**

*   "My Current Courses" is the prominent title at the top.
*   Below the title, two lines provide CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) information:
    *   "Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) till this term - 7.8"
    *   "Project Cumulative Grade Point Average (Project CGPA) till this term - 0.0"

**Course Cards:**

The main content consists of two course cards, each with similar structural elements:

**1. Business Data Management**

*   **Title:** "Business Data Management" in a large, prominent font.
*   **Status:** "REPEAT FULL COURSE" below the course title, indicating this is not the first time taking the course.
*   **Assignments:**
    *   Week 1 Assignment - 25.00
    *   Week 2 Assignment - 50.00
*   **Button:** "Go to Course page >" is a clickable button that directs the user to more information about this specific course.

**2. Tools in Data Science**

*   **Title:** "Tools in Data Science" in a large, prominent font.
*   **Status:** "NEW COURSE" below the course title.
*   **Assignments:**
    *   Week 1 Assignment - 35.00
    *   Week 2 Assignment - 45.00
    *   Week 3 Assignment - 0.00
    *   Week 4 Assignment - 20.00
    *   Week 5 Assignment - 50.00
*   **Quiz:**
    *   PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 - Absent
*   **Button:** "Go to Course page >" is a clickable button that directs the user to more information about this specific course.

**Color Scheme:**

The color scheme is dominated by dark brown (perhaps a gradient) for the background of the course cards and headings, with white text for readability. This gives the interface a professional and somewhat formal look.

**Overall Impression:**

The image depicts a student's view of their enrolled courses, showcasing their assignments and grades for each course. It provides a quick overview of their academic performance and allows them to access more detailed information for each course.

Topic moved to the appropriate category in order to get faster responses.


Please make it easier for others to help you, by ensuring that topics are created in the correct categories.

Scores have not yet been pushed for everyone. You have to wait till operations push it (most likely Tuesday).


Kind regards
