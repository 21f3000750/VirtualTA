Dear TDS Team,


I have verified my submission, and my repository 
does include a Dockerfile
, and the 
Docker image is accessible on DockerHub
. Please find the attached screenshot as proof. Kindly review my submission again and let me know if any further action is needed.


Looking forward to your confirmation.


Best regards,

Arnav Mehta

**Image Description:** [Image analysis : The image displays a file directory structure, likely from a code editor or file explorer, set against a dark blue background. The directory contains a mix of files and folders.

At the top, a folder denoted as ".." is visible. Next, there are two folders named "LLM_PROJECT1" and "__pycache__".

Following the folders are several files, identified by the page icon with a folded corner. These files are: "Dockerfile", "LICENSE", "app.py", "datagen.py", "evaluate.py", "requirements.txt", "tasksA.py", and "tasksB.py".

The presence of files like "app.py," "datagen.py," and "evaluate.py" suggests that this directory might be related to a Python project, while "Dockerfile" indicates it can be containerized with Docker. The "requirements.txt" file likely lists the Python dependencies for the project. The "LICENSE" file probably contains information about the software license. The folder name "LLM_PROJECT1" hints at the project possibly being related to a Large Language Model. is not a valid file path.]

**Image Description:** [Image analysis : The image shows a dark blue interface element, likely from a web or application user interface, displaying information about a project.

On the left is a stylized cube icon, rendered in a blue-gray color. 

To the right of the icon is the project title: "arnavmehta2025/llm_project1" in white text.
Below the title is the line: "By arnavmehta2025" in a smaller font and blue underlined text. Next to it, in a smaller font, is "Updated 2 days ago."
There is a blue "IMAGE" label below the title.

At the bottom of the element, there's a star icon followed by the number "0" and a download icon followed by the number "16". is not a valid file path.]

Good Morning Sir,

Sir even I am facing a similar issue, even though sanity check for docker image on docker hub was cleared but got a mail saying ‘dockerfile’ not present in the GitHub repo while it clearly was. Sir please look into it we have given so many days to complete this project.


Looking forward to your reply.


Thank you

So the reason for the failure is:


You had initially put your Dockerfile inside a directory called TDSP-1-main instead of being directly in your repo. (On 15th Feb 1:26AM)


Then when our automated script checked if students repos met the requirements and yours did not we immediately sent out a warning email as a opportunity for students to make the necessary corrections.


Then once you realised your mistake, on 
Feb 17th at 9:11 pm IST
 i.e 
yesteday
, you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations.


Then you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=“21f3002647, post:1, topic:167471”]

showing that your files are in the correct place.


We do not take into consideration modifications to your repo after the deadline because then we would have to extend that curtesy to all students.


Kind regards

**Image Description:** [Image analysis : The image depicts a file directory listing, most likely from a code editor or file explorer. The background is a dark blue/gray color. The following items are listed:

- ".." (a folder indicating the parent directory)
- "LLM_PROJECT1" (a folder)
- "__pycache__" (a folder, likely automatically generated by Python)
- "Dockerfile" (a file)
- "LICENSE" (a file)
- "app.py" (a Python file)
- "datagen.py" (a Python file)
- "evaluate.py" (a Python file)
- "requirements.txt" (a file listing Python dependencies)
- "tasksA.py" (a Python file)
- "tasksB.py" (a Python file)

Based on the names of the files and folders, it seems like this directory contains a Python project (likely related to a Large Language Model or LLM) which is being developed. It also includes a Dockerfile for containerization and a LICENSE file for licensing information. is not a valid file path.]

@carlton
 sir

Yes, I corrected my repo at 9:11 PM IST, but I had actually written and submitted my query much earlier at 4 PM. At that time, I wasn’t entirely sure if this was the actual issue, but it looks like it was.


I understand that the deadline had already passed, and I only saw the email later. I had two GATE papers on the 15th and an interview on the 16th, so I was extremely busy and couldn’t check my emails sooner. However, I had raised my concern well before making the correction, so I’d really appreciate it if my submission could still be considered 


Kind regards,

Arnav Mehta

Sir, please consider it we have spent a lot of time, in my case just the d in Dockerfile was small that too on remote repository. On my local repository it was Dockerfile only I even have a published docker image as verified by you autated script only. The name of the file on remote repository did not change even after commit it through my local repo, once I read the mail in morning it was only then I realised it wasn’t changed on GitHub repo.


Sir I understand the deadline has passed and I am not asking for a resubmission, I am just asking to consider the already submitted work, just that. It would be really helpful. I just have one commit on my repo that too “Rename dockerfile to Dokerfile” . Sir please attest consider what we have already submitted. I have made no changes as you can verify it too.


Sir it is a humble request to please consider it.


Warm Regards,

Satvik Sawhney
