 Sir, I want to clarify something about the peer grading process. Some of the files of the student assigned to me are not accessble and others are missing. How am I to grade each thing? From what I understand analysis must be graded based on the shared files but if im not able to access them what should I do? I think requesting view access might violate the spirit of the grading exercise.


Please help me out on what to do. Thanks.

Upon checking further, in the assignment we were asked only to share access with se2002@study.iitm.ac.in . So I think all of us might have this issue. what do we do?

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a Google Sheets access request screen. It is clean and modern in its design, featuring Google's branding and illustration style.

**Textual Elements:**

*   **Header:** "Google Sheets" (top left)
*   **Main Message:** "You need access"
*   **Subtext:** "Request access, or switch to an account with access. Learn more"
*   **Form Field:** A text input field with the label "Message (optional)" for the user to write a message to the file owner.
*   **Button:** A blue button labeled "Request access".
*   **Footer:** "You're signed in as" followed by a rounded rectangular section displaying the user's email address: "22f2000644@ds.study.iitm.ac.in". There is a user profile icon next to the email address.

**Visual Elements & Illustration:**

*   **Google Sheets Logo:** A green and white square icon that's the Google Sheets logo.
*   **Illustration:** On the right side of the screen, there's an illustration featuring a stylized person seemingly walking out of a document. The illustration features a person with red hair, wearing a light blue top and white pants. They appear to be exiting a large green document that has a hole in it. Additional shapes like circles and triangles appear. The illustration is in a minimalist, line art style.
*   **Color Palette:** The design uses Google's typical color palette (primarily white, with blue accents, green, yellow, and other pastel colors in the illustration).

**Functionality and User Interface:**

The screen suggests a situation where the user is trying to access a Google Sheet but lacks the necessary permissions. The user has the options to request access by typing a message and clicking on the "Request Access" button, or switching to another account with access (implied by the initial text). It displays the logged-in user's email address.

**In Summary:** The image depicts a standard Google Sheets access request screen, aiming to guide the user in gaining access to a file.

**Image Description:** The image contains a set of instructions labeled "Tasks:". It details two actions to be taken:

1.  **Create a Google Sheet:** The first instruction involves creating a new, blank Google Sheet workbook. The workbook should be named "ga.7.1.rollno", but the user is instructed to replace "rollno" with their IITM roll number, excluding the domain part (e.g., the part after the "@" symbol).
2.  **Share the Sheet:** The second instruction requires the user to share the created workbook with editing rights to the email address "se2002@study.iitm.ac.in". Crucially, it specifies that if this sharing step isn't done *first*, the submission won't be considered.

In summary, the image presents a step-by-step guide for a task related to Google Sheets, likely for an assignment or submission.
