### Image Insight:

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of what appears to be a student's online course dashboard or gradebook.  It lists modules with associated assignments and projects.  Let's break down the content:

* **Module Structure:** The course is divided into five modules: "Development Tools," "Deployment Tools," "Large Language Models," "Data Sourcing," and "Data Preparation." Each module is presented as a collapsible section, indicated by small downward-pointing arrows next to each module title.

* **Assignments and Projects:**
    * **Module 2 ("Deployment Tools")** contains a graded assignment titled "Graded Assignment 2" with a due date of February 2nd, 2025. The status of this assignment is "Not Submitted". A table with columns for "Your Score," "Peer Average," and "Median Score" is displayed but shows no scores yet, indicated by hyphens.
    * **Module 3 ("Large Language Models")** includes a single project, "Project 1."  The content of the project is hidden behind a collapsible section.
    * Modules 1, 4 and 5 have no visible assignments or projects.

* **Grading Information:** The table in Module 2 indicates that the platform provides a student's score, the peer average, and the median score for assignments.

In short, the image provides a snapshot of a student's progress in an online course where one assignment is overdue and the others are not yet assessed.  The course focuses on tools and technologies related to large language models and data science.

 This is not the screen where you see your scores for Tools in Data Science. Its only shown on dashboard. Can you send a screenshot of your dashboard. Thanks


Kind regards
