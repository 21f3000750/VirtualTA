**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Structure:**

*   The image appears to be a screenshot of a web-based user interface or code editor.
*   It contains a question, an input field (likely for entering a URL), and an error message.

**Textual Content:**

*   **Question:** "What is the GitHub Pages URL? It might look like: `https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/`" This suggests the interface is related to GitHub Pages and asks the user to input the URL of a GitHub Pages site. The provided example shows the general structure of a GitHub Pages URL, with placeholders for the user's GitHub username and repository name.
*   **Input Field:** A rectangular input field is provided for the user to enter their GitHub Pages URL. It has a red border and an exclamation point symbol inside a circle in the upper right corner, possibly indicating an error or warning.
*   **Error Message:** "Error: 22f3001315@ds.study.iitm.ac.in is not in the response: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"> <head> <meta charset="UTF-8"> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> <title>Dolphin Facts</title> <style> body {font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: #e0f7fa; color: #333; text-align:" This error message appears to be the result of the user's input. It suggests that the user's input or attempted connection to the URL did not contain information, specifically a string like "22f3001315@ds.study.iitm.ac.in". Furthermore, the image shows parts of the HTML code for a webpage titled "Dolphin Facts."

**Visual Elements:**

*   **Color Scheme:** Dark background with white and red text, the red highlighting errors or warnings.
*   **Formatting:** The image is clean with a simple layout.

**Inferences:**

*   The image likely relates to a tool or application that:
    *   Requires the user to input a GitHub Pages URL.
    *   Checks whether a certain string is included in the response.
    *   Possibly tests the webpage in a way that confirms a certain string is included in the information.
*   The user's input or the targeted URL generated an error or failure.

Let me know if you have any more questions about the image!

Check your browser console most probably CORS is causing problem.


Try adding CORS to your code it might work.


Kind regards

**Image Description:** The image shows a Python code editor (likely VS Code or a similar IDE) running a FastAPI application, alongside a terminal window.

**Code Editor:**

*   **File:** The active file is `main.py`.
*   **Imports:** The code imports modules like `FastAPI`, `Query`, `CORSMiddleware`, `List`, `Optional` from `fastapi`, and `csv`.
*   **CORS Setup:** It sets up CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) middleware, allowing all origins, credentials, methods, and headers.
*   **Student Data Loading:** It reads student data from a CSV file (`q-fastapi.csv`), likely in a user's Downloads directory, and stores it in a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a student and contains 'studentId' (integer) and 'class' keys.
*   **API Endpoint:** It defines an API endpoint `/api` using `@app.get`. This endpoint likely takes a `class_` parameter (a list of strings, optional), which it uses to filter students. The function `get_students` retrieves student data based on provided class.
*   **Uvicorn Run:** The code includes a section to run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn, specifying the host as `127.0.0.1` (localhost) and the port as `8000`.

**Terminal Window:**

*   **Environment:** It shows the terminal with a Python environment, likely with dependencies installed.
*   **Uvicorn Server:** The terminal output shows that Uvicorn is running, serving the FastAPI application on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
*   **Requests & Responses:** The terminal logs HTTP requests and responses, showing GET and OPTIONS requests. It indicates successful responses (200 OK) and some "Not Found" responses. It also shows API endpoints tested, like `/api` and `/api/classA`.
*   **Debugging Lines**: The code has print statements,  and `Debugging Line` comments indicate that the developer is using print statements for debugging their code.

**Other Details**

*   **Interface:** The image also includes the MacOS interface with a Dock at the bottom with icons, menu bar at the top, and the date.

**In essence:** The image shows a FastAPI application for managing student data (likely retrieved from a CSV file) being developed and tested, with the server running and logging API requests in a terminal.

Facing Issue in GA 2 Question 10 LLM ngrok


image
1920×886 45.7 KB

I tired multiple times but issue is still there.


@carlton
 
@Jivraj
 
@s.anand
 Kindly help me out.

### Image Insight:
![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/e/2/e2d34a628bc87d88e8e28cbb9a08254c16f6ba76_2_690x318.png)

**Image Description:** The image displays an error message related to ngrok, a tool for creating secure tunnels to local servers. Here's a detailed breakdown:

**1. Visual Layout:**

*   The image has a clean, white background.
*   Across the top, there's a progress bar-like graphic, showing four steps: "Internet," "ngrok Edge," "ngrok Agent," and "Your Service." The "Your Service" step is marked with a red "X" indicating a failure.
*   The main content is a rectangular area containing the error message and instructions.

**2. Error Message:**

*   **Title:** "ERR\_NGROK\_8012"
*   **Explanation:** "Traffic was successfully tunneled to the ngrok agent, but the agent failed to establish a connection to the upstream web service at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). The error encountered was:"
*   **Specific Error:** "dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused" - This indicates the local server on port 8080 is not accessible.
*   **Button:**  "Get help with this error" - This likely links to documentation or troubleshooting steps.

**3. Instructions and Suggestions:**

*   **For the Developer:**
    *   Make sure a web service is running on `http://localhost:8080`.
    *   Suggests using `cURL` or a browser to test the service.
    *   Provides a link to documentation (implied by "Check out the docs to get help with this error").
*   **For the Visitor:**
    *   Suggests waiting a few minutes and refreshing the page.
    *   Suggests contacting the developer if the problem persists.

**4. Key Elements and their Significance:**

*   **ngrok:** The core technology is identified as ngrok, a tunneling service for exposing local servers to the internet.
*   **localhost:8080:** This is the typical address where a local web server might be running.
*   **"connection refused":**  The error message strongly indicates that the local server on port 8080 is either not running or is blocked by a firewall.

**In Summary:**  The image shows a common error scenario in ngrok where the local server isn't accessible, probably because it's not running or blocked.  It provides troubleshooting guidance for both developers (ensuring the service is running) and visitors (suggesting a refresh).

Hi Mishkat,


Please use  triple backticks to encapsulate code, so that we can debug your code more easily.


eg


if __name__ == "__main__":
   print ("Hello")



Please use this discourse etiquette to share code.

## Post #14 by Jivraj (Post ID: 579600)
Hi Mishkat,


This error is because you are filtering on 
class_
 instead of 
class


So if you send a request on 
http://127.0.0.1/api?class_=1S
 you will see response for that 
1S
 class only.


kind regards

## Post #16 by Jivraj (Post ID: 579617)
Hi Guddu,


Inside 
index.html
 file of your repo, don’t put html code just put your email in the file nothing else.


This issue is because when you deploy on github pages it encrypts any email that’s on page.


kind regards.

**Image Description:** The image displays an error message from Docker Desktop related to the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).  Here's a detailed breakdown:

*   **Title:** "Docker Desktop - Unexpected WSL error". This clearly indicates the issue is with Docker Desktop and the WSL environment.
*   **Description:** "An unexpected error occurred while executing a WSL command."  This provides the general cause of the problem.
*   **Instructions:** The text offers troubleshooting steps:
    *   Shutting down WSL using the command `wsl --shutdown` and/or rebooting the machine.
    *   Reinstalling WSL and/or Docker Desktop.
    *   "collect diagnostics and submit an issue". This suggests a way to report the problem to the Docker developers, and it is linked, allowing the user to submit a report.
*   **Error Details (in the black box):**  Provides specific details about the error. It mentions "deploying WSL2 distributions", "ensuring main distro is deployed", and specifically points out a failure during the import of the "docker-desktop" WSL distro with the message "WSL2 is not supported with". This may indicate the user is attempting to import an outdated version of the Docker image.
*   **Links/Buttons:**
    *   "Read our policy for uploaded diagnostic data": Provides a link (represented by the blue text with an icon) to the policy.
    *   "Gather diagnostics": A button to gather diagnostics, presumably to help debug the issue.
    *   "Quit": A button to close the error message.
*   **Visuals:** The image has a dark blue background with white and light gray text. There is a red exclamation mark icon at the top, further drawing attention to the error.

## Post #18 by Jivraj (Post ID: 579625)
Hi Telvin,


Try opening 
localhost:8080
 in browser if that works, if it opens in browser then issue might be with some network configurations.


I solved this question in github codespace, which didn’t require me to make any changes in network.


kind regards


kind regards

## Post #19 by s.anand (Post ID: 579634)
@Nelson
 I would recommend 
Podman
 or 
Docker CE
 rather than 
Docker Desktop
.


Docker Desktop is 
not free for organizations over 250 people
 and many organizations have therefore moved away from it.

@Jivraj
 I tired , in browser localhost:8080 is working fine but ngrok is not working. Is there any other tools for tunneling that can be used.

---

## Post #21 by s.anand (Post ID: 579662)
@22f2001640
 in that case




a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or


a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080




Please try one of these:




Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network


GitHub codespaces, as 
@Jivraj
 suggested




You 
could
 try an ngrok alternative like 
localtunnel
 but I don’t think that’ll work.

## Post #22 by Nelson (Post ID: 579678)
Thank you, Sir!




What is the Docker image URL? It should look like: 
https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/$USER/$REPO/general




If I use Podman, will the answer be correct assuming I have done all steps correctly?

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image displays a computer screen with multiple windows open, suggesting a programming or software development context. The screen is divided into three main areas: a terminal, a web browser, and a text editor (likely a Python interpreter, as it mentions "mish - Python").

**1. Web Browser (Top Right):**

*   **URL:**  The browser's address bar shows `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga2`. This is likely a grading or assignment platform.
*   **Content:** The main content window displays a page with text. It contains instructions or a problem statement related to an API that handles student data and how to filter for students of certain classes. Specific instructions mention that "/api?class=1A" should return only students in class 1A and that "/api?class=1A&class=1B" should return only students in classes 1A and 1B. It also mentions the necessity of "CORS enabled" for requests to the server to succeed.
*   **Grading elements:** The page has a green bar at the top with "Due Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST", "Score: 5.5/10," "Check," and "Save" buttons. This confirms that it's a graded assignment.
*   **API URL:** The instructions specify that the API URL should be "/api".
*   **Response data:** It also displays the response from the API at the end. The response is a list of student objects with their student IDs and classes.
*   **Output:** The output has some entries that match the format specified in the prompt (e.g. `("studentid":1,"class":"10I")`).

**2. Terminal (Bottom Left):**

*   **Window Title:** "mish - Python main.py - 80x24" - This indicates the user is running a Python script named `main.py` in a terminal.
*   **Commands/Output:** The terminal displays various commands and outputs, most of which likely concern requests to an API endpoint. It shows HTTP requests (GET, OPTIONS) to the API. The API endpoints include `api?class=15` along with information about the request and responses like "200 OK".
*   **Requests:** The terminal shows requests to `/api?class=15` and to other endpoints.
*   **Response preview:** Above the terminal, the image displays a section of JSON that is returned from the server for class 15.

**3.  Another Browser (Top Left):**

*   **URL:** Shows "127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=15" which suggests the local host and the local version of the API, to test against.
*   **Output:** The page displays the JSON data of the students that are in the class 15.

**4. Miscellaneous:**

*   **Dock:** There's a standard macOS dock at the bottom of the screen. The icons include Finder, Launchpad, a web browser, an email client, and others.

**In Summary:**

The image portrays a developer or student working on a coding assignment. The task involves building an API that retrieves student data based on class filters. The user is testing the API using a web browser and a terminal, examining the responses, and evaluating the results within a grading platform. The core focus is on API development, request testing, and evaluating the API's responses, especially the JSON responses.

Hi Mishkat,


The GA url encoded parameter is 
class

In your screenshot, you are using 
class_

Your code that we examined earlier also accepts 
class_
 as the parameter instead of 
class
 as required by the GA

The GA will test your deployment by sending it a request with the url encoded parameter 
class

**Image Description:** The image is a screenshot of a web page displaying an error message related to ngrok. Here's a detailed breakdown:

**General Overview:**

*   The page has a white background with text and visual elements.
*   The content seems to be a technical error message.
*   There's a progress indicator at the top showing the stages of a process, with one step marked with a red "X", indicating an error.

**Specific Elements and Text:**

*   **Top Navigation (Browser):** The image shows a browser window with a dark red address bar. There are several tabs open, with the current tab displaying the URL "9eab-2402-e280-3e1e-19a-508b-9d2e-a63e-931c.ngrok-free.app". Several other tabs suggest web-based tools or pages are open.
*   **Progress Indicator:** Above the error message, a horizontal bar represents the connection steps. It contains the following stages: "Internet", "ngrok Edge", "ngrok Agent", and "Your Service". The last step "Your Service" is marked with a red "X", indicating a failure.
*   **Error Message:** The main content is an error message labeled "ERR\_NGROK\_8012". It provides the following information:
    *   "Traffic was successfully tunneled to the ngrok agent, but the agent failed to establish a connection to the upstream web service at http://localhost:5000. The error encountered was:"
    *   A sub-message: "dial tcp [::1]:5000: connect: connection refused"
    *   A link: "Get help with this error"
*   **Developer Information:** After the error message, two sections provide guidance:
    *   "If you're the developer of this page" includes instructions to check if a web service is running on "http://localhost:5000".
    *   "If you're a visitor of this page" advises the visitor to refresh the page or contact the developer.
*   **Footer:** "Powered by ngrok" is at the bottom of the page.

**Analysis:**

*   The error indicates a problem with connecting a local service to the internet via ngrok.
*   The error specifically states that the service on "http://localhost:5000" couldn't be reached. The "connection refused" message is common when the service isn't running or not accessible on that port on the local machine.
*   The page gives the user a clear path to troubleshoot the issue, depending on their role (developer or visitor).

**In summary:** The image shows an ngrok error page indicating that a local service couldn't be accessed through a ngrok tunnel. The page provides relevant information and guidance for debugging and fixing the issue.

Hi Mishkat,


In your code, the word 
class
 is a reserved keyword in python. So simply changing 
class_
 to 
class
 is not going to work. The 
only
 thing you need to change is the keyword accepted by the api 
not
 the variable name used inside your function. Hope that helps you narrow down the problem.


Kind regards

Hi Team ,


For GA - 2 , Question 6:

I am done with the code, deployed same on vercel.

And It is working fine gives correct json response as expected in browser.


But When I try to that on portal It gives me “CORS Missing Allow Origin” Error.


Screenshot 2025-01-16 at 6.58.43 PM
3570×1344 436 KB


I have added “Access-Control-Allow-Origin” as “*” for allowing request from any origin.


I get the correct response in browser but it fails in quiz portal.

Can anyone please suggest what exactly I am missing here.


Thanks

Kushagra

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Main Content:**

*   **Text Instructions:** The image primarily displays instructions, likely related to a programming or web development task. The instructions involve:
    *   Downloading a file named `q-vercel-python.json`.
    *   Creating and deploying a Python app to Vercel.
    *   Exposing an API that responds to a specific request format (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?nameX=X&nameY=Y`) with a JSON response containing "marks".
*   **Code Example:** A sample JSON response is provided: `{"marks": [10, 20]}`.
*   **Expected URL:**  The instructions provide an example of what the Vercel URL should look like, followed by the specific Vercel URL attempted.
*   **Error Message:** An error message, "TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource," indicates a problem when the resource is being fetched.
*   **GUI elements** are visible.

**GUI Elements (likely a browser's developer tools):**

*   **Network Tab:** A network analysis tab, likely from a browser's developer tools, is displayed.
*   **Headers Tab:** The Headers section of the network tab is open, displaying information about a specific GET request.

**Additional Details from GUI:**

*   The status code of the request appears to be 200, indicating success.
*   The request URL is partially visible and appears to be attempting to access a Vercel project.
*   The headers section displays details about the request.
*   The "Create a Github Action (1.5 marks)" label suggests that the context is an assignment.

**Overall, the image seems to be a screenshot showing the process of building and testing a web API using Vercel, along with troubleshooting a potential network issue encountered during a development step.**

**Image Description:** The image displays a section with text related to a Vercel URL. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Headline:** "What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: https://your-app.vercel.app/api" This line poses a question and offers an example of what a Vercel URL might look like. The example URL suggests a structure: "https://\[app-name].vercel.app/api."
*   **Input Field:** Below the introductory text, there's an input field with "https://your-app2.vercel.app/api" filled in. The field is highlighted by a red outline, likely indicating an error or issue. There is a warning icon in the form of a small circle with a exclamation mark in it at the end of the input field.
*   **Error Message:** Underneath the input field, the text "TypeError: Failed to fetch" is displayed in red. This indicates that there was an error trying to retrieve data from the specified URL.

In summary, the image seems to be a part of some interface or application that is checking or validating a Vercel URL. The URL provided is failing to fetch, resulting in an error message and a warning icon.

Hi Aindree,


I tried to send a request to your application 
https://your-app2.vercel.app/api
 with url encoded parameter

. It should fetch marks of that particular class. But in response it sends 
{"marks": []}

For the questions such as cors, llm i have to locally run the code and submit it.After a while if i have to submit it again the prev url that i have submitted is throwing an error. Maybe becaue it is checking the url again at the time of submission. Fix this issue, the similar issue lies with the image compression problem. when i upload the code and checks and submits it at that time i got the marks but after sometime if i make the change in some other question the file that i uploaded prev is nowhere to found.so please fix this issue

Hi Tushar,


For questions which require submitting a url, when you click on save button all those server’s should be running.


For that image uploading question one solution would be to keep image in a particular directory, and then upload from there every time you make a submission.

For the Q.2 on image compression, for PNG, SVG or WEBP files, I’m getting the error “Could not process image. Is it browser supported image? Image pixels do not match the original” (I believe the last part is not applicable as the image was not processed ).

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Structure:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a web browser displaying a JSON response. It shows data related to "marks."

**Key Elements:**

*   **Browser Interface:** The screenshot includes the browser's address bar, navigation buttons, and the "Pretty-print" button.
*   **URL:** The address bar displays a URL, which is: `student-marks-gb9zwxnfx-tushars-projects-f2a54030.vercel.app/api?name=IjJOGavw&name=Ry2N2zqyxV`. This suggests a web application, likely fetching data from an API.
*   **JSON Response:** The main content is a JSON object.
*   **JSON Data:** The JSON contains one key-value pair:
    *   `"marks"`: an array containing the numbers `65` and `74`.

**Interpretation:**

The image shows a web application querying for a student's marks, using an API. The JSON response returned from the API contains an array of student's marks, which are 65 and 74.

i have added the header key in order to use the cors as said in the vercel doc but still i am getting that error.

what to do?

i have added the cors in the app.py file as well


from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import json
from flask_cors import CORS


app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

# Load the data
with open("q-vercel-python.json", "r") as f:
    data = json.load(f)


@app.route("/api", methods=["GET"])
def get_marks():
    names = request.args.getlist("name")
    marks = [student["marks"] for student in data if student["name"] in names]
    return jsonify({"marks": marks})

@23f2003751

While I understand why you might choose to use 
flask
 due to your familiarity with it,

the 
http.server
 library is just very simple to use.


The 
only extra line of code
 you would need inside your 
get
 request if you used the 
http.server
 library would be:


self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")


Try to rewrite your code using 
http.server
  library so that your debugging for simple tasks like this is easy.


The boilerplate code for a 
get
 request using the 
http.server
 library was already given in Q6. So you have to do very minimal modifications to it and it works like a charm.


Kind regards

 You would have to be a bit more specific on what exactly is the nature of your error on your machine.


GA2 - Q6 has no dependency on the OS or your computer. It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems.


Now typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly.


Also the live sessions on 
youtube
 will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing.


There will be session 
2025-01-20T14:30:00Z
→
2025-01-20T16:30:00Z
 which will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries.


The session is in your course calendar and the meet link is

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall:**

The image is a screenshot of a web browser window. The content displayed suggests a developer environment or an application displaying data. The background is black, emphasizing the text and code-like output.

**Browser and URL:**

*   **Browser:** The browser appears to be Google Chrome, indicated by the tab style and controls.
*   **URL:** The URL bar shows the web address: `https://vercel-fastapi-aa0kdktjz-mishkat02s-projects.vercel.app/api?name=IE&name=G6k`. This points to a project hosted on Vercel, likely involving FastAPI (a Python web framework). The URL also includes query parameters: `name=IE` and `name=G6k`.

**Content Display:**

*   **"Pretty print"**: The text "Pretty print" at the beginning of the content, suggests the use of a tool or function to format data output in a readable manner.
*   **Data Output:** The main part of the display shows: `("marks": [58,53])`. This is a Python dictionary or a similar data structure, displaying the key-value pair "marks" with a value of a list `[58, 53]`. This could be part of the response from the API call.

**Tabs & Context:**

The browser has several tabs open, visible at the top:

*   "Project 1: : :
*   "TDS 2025"
*   "GA2-Dep"
*   "how to inst"
*   "(no subject"
*   "ChatGPT"
*   "vercel-fast"
*   "vercel-fast"
*   "vercel-fast"
*   "+" (to add another tab)

These tabs suggest that the user is working on a programming project and might be looking up documentation (like "how to inst" tab), using ChatGPT, testing different apps, and more.

**In summary:**
The image depicts a browser with the output of an API call from a Vercel hosted project. The output is a formatted data structure showing "marks". The context is of a developer, likely interacting with the API and displaying the results.

@23F300327


Typically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code.


When a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api

with parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request.


The rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program.


That’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this


# api/index.py
import json
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler

class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type','application/json')
        self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(json.dumps({"message": "Hello!"}).encode('utf-8'))
        return



Notice there is no 
if __name__ == "__main__":
 code block.

This would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application.


if __name__ == "__main__":
 is used to execute some code 
only
 if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application.


Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default 
handler
 class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared.


Another possible problem:

By default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised  UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues 
TDS > Development Tools > unicode


So converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it.


Let us know what worked. We are all learning from each other.


Kind regards

### Image Insight:
![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/3/7/37d1ddfd387a975b90239f785c0023c91ddfbf14.png)

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Appearance:**

The image presents a text-based display on a dark background.  The text is primarily in white, with some elements highlighted in red.

**Textual Content and Structure:**

1.  **Header:** "What is your repository URL? It will look like: https://github.com/USER/REPO"
    *   This line is at the top and poses a question about a repository URL.
    *   It provides a format example: `https://github.com/USER/REPO` (using the example, in color red) suggesting how the user's input should look.
2.  **Input Field or Display Area:**  A box beneath the question contains the URL: "https://github.com/NAMAN-BERI/actions.git"
    *   This likely represents the user's input or the system's attempt to access a specific repository.
    *   The red border surrounding the URL may indicate focus or selection.
3.  **Error Message:**  "Error: No runs found"
    *   This is the error message in color red. It suggests that, after the user inputting their repository URL, the system couldn't find any "runs".

**Other Features:**

*   The use of a dark, almost black, background makes the text stand out.
*   The red color is likely used for emphasis, probably highlighting important information like the suggested format and the error message.

**In Summary:**

**Image Description:** The image displays an error message related to a website hosted on Cloudflare. Here's a breakdown of the content:

**Top Section:**

*   Provides instructions: "Download Llamafile. Run the Llama 3.2-18-Instruct.06 K.llamafile model with it." and  "Create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using ngrok"
*   The user is prompted to use `ngrok` to create a tunnel.
*   A suggested format for the ngrok URL is given: "What is the ngrok URL? It might look like: https://[random].ngrok-free.app/".
*   The specific ngrok URL found in the image is https://58e1-150-107-42-211.ngrok-free.app.

**Error Message Section:**

*   **Error Header**: "Error: Response is not valid JSON". This indicates that the server is returning a response that is not properly formatted JSON.
*   **HTML Content**: The error details are presented within an HTML structure. The HTML starts with a standard `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, includes a `<head>` section with metadata (title, character set, viewport, etc.), and a `<body>` section containing the error display.
*   **Specific Error Information**:
    *   The error details are presented within a specific HTML structure.
    *   `Worker threw exception`
    *   `Ray ID: 9058ac347bd6dc94`
    *   Date and Time: 2025-01-21 16:27:37 UTC
    *   `You've requested a page on a website (exam.sanand workers.dev) that is on the Cloudflare network. An unknown error occurred while rendering the page.`
    *   "If you are the owner of this website, you should <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/login?utm_source=error_100x">login to Cloudflare</a> and check the error logs for exam.sanand workers.dev."
    *   Your IP: 150.107.42.211
*   **Cloudflare Branding**: Includes Cloudflare branding in the footer, indicating Cloudflare's involvement.

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a Cloudflare error page, implying an issue with accessing or rendering the content of a website using the provided ngrok URL. The error occurs because of the wrong JSON response from the server. The page provides diagnostic information (Ray ID, IP address) and instructions for the website owner to investigate the problem.

Hi Mishkat,


I think url that you are submitting is wrong one. In below image there are two url’s under Domains those would be correct url’s to be submitted.

For example 
https://tds21jan.vercel.app/
.

**Image Description:** The image shows a dashboard or a similar interface related to web deployment, likely from a platform like Vercel. Here's a breakdown:

**Main Components and Details:**

*   **Error Message Area (Left):** A large white box displays an error message. The text reads:
    *   `404 NOT_FOUND`
    *   `Code: NOT_FOUND`
    *   `ID: <a series of characters>`
    *   There is a button: "Read our documentation to learn more about this error."
*   **Deployment Section (Right):** This section gives details about the deployed project.
    *   **Deployment Name:** `tds21jan-ghtj3xr7w-jivraj-18s-projects.vercel.app`
    *   **Domains:** Lists the domains associated with the deployment: `tds21jan.vercel.app`, `tds21jan-jivraj-18s-projects.vercel.app` (+1, indicating additional similar domains are associated)
    *   **Status:** `Ready` (indicated by a green circle), indicating successful deployment.
    *   **Created:** "18h ago by jivraj-18" with a circle containing orange and purple color on it.
    *   **Source:**
        *   "`<>` View code"
        *   "`>_` vercel deploy"
*   **Bottom Section:** There's a prompt to "Connect your Project with a Git repository to create a Production Deployment." There is also a "Connect Git re" button.

**Interpretation and Context:**

*   The primary function of this interface is to monitor and manage the status of a web deployment, including its status (Ready or error), domains, and deployment details.
*   The "404 NOT\_FOUND" error suggests that a specific route or resource within the deployment could not be found.
*   The presence of "vercel deploy" and a "Connect Git" button strongly indicates the use of the Vercel platform for deploying web applications.
*   The deployment status indicates that a deployment has successfully completed.

## Post #63 by Jivraj (Post ID: 583228)
I’m not sure of the exact reason for the issue, but there are different ways to deploy to Vercel. One approach is using a 
vercel.json
 configuration file, and another is adding headers directly in the API code.


You can follow 
Gui Bibeau’s guide
 to add CORS headers to your deployment setup. Also check the recording from yesterday’s session for more clarity in that session Carlton deployed application directly from github repository. If you’re still facing issues, you can join today’s session at 9 PM.


For deploying a Flask or FastAPI app to Vercel, refer to 
this guide on DEV Community
. I’ve tried both methods, and they work well.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a web page or application. It's divided into two primary sections: a top section that seems to be related to a quiz or assessment, and a bottom section with code and command details.

**Top Section (Quiz/Assessment Interface):**

*   **Header:** Contains information such as the time ("11:59 pm IST"), the score ("53/10"), and buttons labeled "Check" and "Save."  The green bar at the top indicates a status bar of some kind.
*   **Instructions:**  A list of instructions for a quiz.  These instructions cover:
    *   Learning the material
    *   Checking answers regularly with a "Check" button
    *   Saving progress regularly with a "Save" button.
    *   Reloading the page, which is stated as OK
    *   Possible browser struggles and troubleshooting tips (e.g., security settings)
    *   Permissible use of resources (internet, friends, etc.)
    *   A note that the quiz is "hackable"
*   **Questions/Discussion:** A button prompting users to "Have questions?" and links to a Discourse discussion.
*   **Login Information:**  Shows the user is logged in and has their username/ID.
*   **Recent Saves:** This shows previous save times and scores from a quiz:  1/22/2023. 1:31:03 PM Score: 8, 1/22/2023. 1:30:56 PM Score: 8, 1/22/2023, 1:07:43 PM Score: 7

**Bottom Section (Code/Command Line):**

*   **Instructions:** The bottom portion seems to be providing additional instructions, perhaps related to downloading a model and running a server.
*   **Download:** Instruction to download "Gomella. Run the Llama 2 78 instruction Llama.cpp model with it."
*   **Create a funnel**: Instruction to create a funnel to the llamama server using  ngrok.
*   **What is the ngrok URL?**: The instructions have asked "What is the ngrok URL? it might look like: "
*   **Response:**  Below the instructions is a text response, likely from a command line or code execution, containing an "https" and information from an api request.

**Overall Impression:**

The image presents a quiz/assessment interface accompanied by instructions that strongly encourage learners to use external resources and suggests a possible means to obtain the answers to the quiz questions in a separate section. The bottom section is related to creating a local server and obtaining an ngrok URL, possibly to access the quiz remotely or to debug the solution.

From image that you have shared, it explains ngrok tunnel that you are submitting in answer is not running.


For any assignment if it involves running some server then you would need to keep all the server’s running when you submit

*   **Ngrok URL:** The webpage provides an example of what an ngrok URL might look like.
*   **Error Message:** Below the URL, there's an error message displayed, indicating the issue: "Error: Response is not valid JSON...". This error is followed by HTML code, indicating the error is related to an unsupported method 'POST' and server support issue, with error code 501.

**Browser Interface:**

*   The image shows a Chrome web browser on a Mac operating system.
*   The top bar has typical browser controls (back, forward, reload, etc.).

This issue is because localhost is not there is no server available to listen on localhost.You are running ngrok in codespace but Llama server in local machine. run both of them in same machine either codespace or local machine.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of text related to an API (Application Programming Interface) testing or documentation. It highlights a specific API endpoint and provides instructions on how to test it with query parameters. There is a hint of error in the API response and instruction to use the CORS configuration.

**Text Content:**

*   **API Endpoint Instructions:** The primary text focuses on the use of a URL with a query parameter called `class`. It explains that by adding `?class=...` to the API endpoint, you should be able to filter and retrieve data for only the students in specific classes.
    *   Example URL: `/api?class=1A`
    *   Multiple classes example: `/api?class=1A&class=1B`
*   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Note:** There is a reminder to enable CORS in order to allow GET requests from any origin.
*   **API URL Endpoint Example:** The image shows the example URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` that might be used for testing the API.
*   **Error Information**: There is an error message below the URL that indicates that the response received does not match the expected response from a server.
*   **Test Instructions:** A final line instructs the user to send a request with the query parameter `class` and verify if the response matches the data.

**Visual Elements:**

*   **Code-like Formatting:** The text is formatted in a way that suggests it's either a code document or a tutorial of some sort.
*   **Error Highlight:** The error message is visually highlighted by being enclosed within a red border, drawing attention to it.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The presence of error messages within the text suggests that the user is currently facing a problem when trying to access or work with an API.
*   The bottom bar contains information about the current time (06:54) and the date (24-01-2005).
*   There are icons at the bottom of the screen indicating active applications.

In conclusion, the image provides instructions and hints to test an API endpoint and troubleshoot a specific problem.

**Image Description:** Here's a breakdown of the image's content:

**Overall:**

*   The image is a screenshot of a web browser displaying data, likely the output of an API call.
*   The browser window is maximized.

**Key Elements:**

1.  **URL Bar:**
    *   The address bar shows the URL: `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=6X&class=5T&class=78&class=2Z`. This indicates a local server running on port 8000. The URL likely queries an API, potentially filtering results based on class names, such as "6X", "5T", "78", and "2Z".
2.  **Content Display:**
    *   The main content area shows JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) formatted data.
    *   The "Pretty-print" label suggests the JSON has been formatted for readability.
    *   The JSON data is an array of objects. Each object appears to represent student data, containing a `studentId` and a `class` field.
    *   The data structure suggests retrieving information about students and their respective classes.

    *   `jobs:`
    *   `test:`
    *   `steps:`
        *   `name: 23f3001255@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`
        *   `run: echo "Hello, world!"`

**Bottom Section:**
*   A sentence that reads: "Trigger the action and make sure it is the most recent action."
*   A sentence that reads: "What is your repository URL? It will look like: https://github.com/USER/REPO"
*   There's a highlighted input field containing "https://github.com/divya23f3001255/divya.github.io". This URL is incorrect as indicated by the error message.
*   An error message below that reads: "Error: No step matches 23f3001255@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"
*   An "info" icon/symbol, the lowercase 'i' in a circle.

**Overall Interpretation:**
The page appears to be a guide, possibly for a coding exercise/tutorial, that instructs users on how to create and run GitHub Actions with a focus on email addresses. The error message suggests a misconfiguration or problem with the current GitHub Action being implemented based on the user's repo/workflow.

@Jivraj
  Hello Sir, I’m also using Squoosh. The pixel size of the resulting image is 800 x 600 and the file size is 1,473 bytes. The steps I used to create the solution image:




Open Squoosh and load the image


In the dropdown in “Compress” section, select “OxiPNG”. Left the other options unchanged (Interlace checkbox is unchecked, Effort is at 2).


The resulting image is downloaded which has same pixel size as original image but file size is 1,473 bytes




image
398×570 17.5 KB


I also tried WebP with “Lossless” option selected and “Effort” increased to 9. This gives even smaller filesize at just 630 bytes. However, even that image is not accepted. The selected options for WebP are in the screenshot below.

@23f1002382


Nothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat.


That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”.


Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials!


So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done.


In the meanwhile:






























There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything.


Kind regards

Once i close my local llm and close the nrgrok URL (after entering the answer and the answer being correct), the next time I refresh or check the answer in the Ga2 site, q10 gets marked wrong. I have to redo the entire process for it to be correct again.


Can you clarify why this is happening?

---

## Post #93 by carlton (Post ID: 586779)
because it dynamically checks the answer each time a submit is done and if the ngrok tunnel and the service is not running at the time, then it marks it wrong.


Since every student’s answer is going to be unique (unlike a mathematics question), by necessity we have to dynamically check the answer each submit.


The workaround to prevent having to do it all over again, is to simply check all your answers that do not need active running servers first, then before doing a final save, run the servers for the required questions and the ngrok tunnel and submit to get the full marks.


Just dont forget that your last save is what gets graded. Just ignore for now once you got it working. Solve all the other ones first and then for the final submission “get all your ducks in a row.”


Kind regards

hi 
@23f2003853


I think you are running your application server inside a virtual machine because of which it doesn’t have visibility to outside world(request coming from other domains). So you would need to identify  ipaddress of your virtual machine and would need to use that in place of 
127.0.0.1
. Take help from GPT to identify ipaddress of virtual machine.

Hello Sir,


I’ve been working on question 6 and I’m facing this error where the marks are not ordered properly. I believe my code appends the marks based on the names that are inputted in the backend but I’m unable to identify the source of this issue. Please shed some light on the same.

**Image Description:** The image shows a text-based display with a dark background, likely a console output or a developer interface. It contains the following information:

*   **Header:** "Make sure you enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin." This suggests a need to configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing to allow web requests from different origins.

*   **Question:** "What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: https://your-app.vercel.app/api". This indicates that the context is related to a Vercel deployment and the user is being asked to provide the URL of their deployed application's API endpoint. An example URL is provided.

*   **Provided URL:** `https://new1-ivory.vercel.app/api`. This is a user-provided URL for the Vercel API.

*   **Error Message:** "Error: Expected \[73,73,53,63,61] but got \[73,53,61,63,73]". This is an error message that indicates a mismatch between expected and actual data. The error is expressed in a sequence of numbers which are likely ASCII values representing characters. The exact nature of the expected and received data would require further context, likely from code or data being tested.

In summary, the image is likely related to troubleshooting a Vercel deployment, with an error related to comparing sequences of characters and a request for the correct Vercel API URL.

Hi Shalini,


I deployed my code with your dataset and checked and checked answers for your dataset, so there is no errors in backend.


Since you are getting some output, it won’t help to look up to logs from vercel,  just check your code if it’s logically correct.


Kind regards

Here is my code. Could you please help me identify any issues or clarify where I might be going wrong?

### Image Insight:
![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/3/7/371cbe5841fecb6f2b1f1ef4a5341258db49eda3.png)

**Image Description:** The image is a screenshot of Python code, likely related to a web server or API. Here's a detailed breakdown:

**1. Imports:**
   - `import json`:  This line imports the `json` module, which is used for working with JSON data (encoding and decoding).
   - `import os`: This imports the `os` module, providing access to operating system-dependent functionality, particularly for file path manipulation.
   - `from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler`: This imports the `BaseHTTPRequestHandler` class from the `http.server` module, which is used to create custom HTTP request handlers.
   - `from urllib.parse import parse_qs, urlparse`: This imports `parse_qs` and `urlparse` from the `urllib.parse` module. `urlparse` is for parsing URLs, and `parse_qs` is specifically for parsing the query string part of a URL.

**2. Class Definition:**
   - `class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):`: Defines a class named `handler` that inherits from `BaseHTTPRequestHandler`. This means it's creating a custom HTTP request handler.

**3. Methods (Function Definitions):**
   - `def do_GET(self):`: Defines a method to handle GET requests. This is the core function for handling incoming GET requests to the server.
     - **CORS Headers:** The first few lines set CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers to allow requests from any origin (`*`). These headers are essential for allowing web applications from different domains to make requests to the server.
     - **Send Response:**  `self.send_response(200)` sends an HTTP status code of 200 (OK) to the client.
     - **Load JSON Data:**
       - It calculates the path to a JSON file named `q-vercel-python.json` located in a sibling directory using `os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))` and `os.path.join()`.
       - It opens the JSON file in read mode (`"r"`) and loads the JSON data into a variable called `data` using `json.load(file)`.
     - **Parse Query Parameters:**
       - `query_components = parse_qs(urlparse(self.path).query)`: Parses the query string of the URL using `urlparse` to get the query part and then `parse_qs` to parse it into a dictionary-like structure.
       - `names = query_components.get('name', [])`:  Extracts the value of the `name` query parameter. If the `name` parameter isn't present, it defaults to an empty list (`[]`).
     - **Error Handling (If no 'name' parameter):**
       - Checks if the `names` list is empty, signaling that no "name" parameter was provided in the URL. If so:
       - It sends an error response back to the client.
     - **Process Data based on Query Parameter 'name':**
       - It creates an empty list called `marks` to store the found marks.
       - It iterates through the `data` that was loaded from the json file.
       - Inside the loop, it checks if the `name` from the current `entry` within `data` is present within the `names` list (the query parameters). If there's a match, the corresponding `marks` from that entry in the data is appended to the `marks` list.
     - **Construct Response:**
       - If `marks` has values (meaning matches were found), it creates a JSON object with a "marks" key, whose value is the `marks` list.
       - If `marks` is empty, it constructs a JSON object with an "error" key.
     - **Send Response to Client:** The code encodes the response as UTF-8 and sends it to the client.
   - `def do_OPTIONS(self):`: Defines a method to handle OPTIONS requests. This is essential for handling preflight requests for CORS.
     - **CORS Headers:** It sets the same CORS headers as in `do_GET` to allow requests from any origin, indicating to the browser which HTTP methods are allowed.
     - **Send Response:**  `self.send_response(200)` sends an HTTP status code of 200 (OK) to the client.
**In essence, this code likely represents a simple API endpoint that:**

1.  **Accepts GET requests.**
2.  **Loads data from a JSON file.**
3.  **Expects a `name` query parameter in the URL.**  e.g., `http://localhost:8000/?name=John`
4.  **Searches the JSON data for entries that have matching names.**
5.  **If matching names are found, it returns the associated `marks` in a JSON response.**
6.  **If no match or `name` paramter is not provided, returns an error message in JSON format.**
7.  **Handles CORS preflight requests.**

**Purpose:**
This code snippet provides the structure of a simple web API. It’s designed to retrieve data (specifically the `marks`) from a JSON file based on a provided `name` through a GET request. The CORS headers ensure that web applications from other domains can successfully interact with this API.

**Image Description:** The image appears to be a set of instructions for setting up and running a Llamafile model.  It starts with the instruction "Download Llamafile. Run the `Llama-3.2-18-Instruct.06 K.llamafile` model with it."  The next instruction is "Create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using ngrok."  The following line asks "What is the ngrok URL? It might look like: https://[random].ngrok-free.app/". Below this line is a text field containing the URL `https://fd8c-2405-201-6808-a99e-871-6b1a-adb9-36c5.ngrok-free.app/`. This likely indicates the ngrok URL that was generated for the user, used to create a secure tunnel to a local server running the Llamafile model. A warning symbol is visible on the right side of the URL.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Impression:** The image appears to be a snippet from a technical documentation or a user interface related to API development or testing, possibly involving the FastAPI framework. The dark background and text suggest a code editor or terminal environment.

**Textual Content:**

*   **Instructions/Guidance:** The image begins with instructions:
    *   "Make sure you enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin."
    *   "What is the API URL endpoint for FastAPI? It might look like: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api"
*   **Input Field:**  Below this, there's an input field. It's highlighted in red, indicating either a focus state, a required field, or a potential error situation.  The field is partially filled with the URL "http://127.0.0.1:8000/ap".
*   **Error Message:** Immediately below the input field, the error message "TypeError: Load failed" is displayed in red. This suggests a problem with accessing or interpreting the specified URL.
*   **Further Instruction/Hint:** A final sentence: "We'll check by sending a request to this URL with ?class=... added and check if the response matches the data."  This implies some automated validation or testing is planned.

**Visual Elements & Features:**

*   **Input Field:**  A bordered, rectangular input field with a rounded corner design.
*   **Red Border:**  The red border around the input field and the red text for the error message indicate an issue, likely an unsuccessful attempt to connect to the provided URL.
*   **Warning Icon:** Inside the red-bordered box for the input field, there is a warning icon (a red circle with a white exclamation point). This strengthens the indication of an issue.
*   **Font and Style:** The font appears to be monospaced, consistent with a code editor or terminal interface.

**Possible Functionality/Purpose:**

The context suggests this is likely a tool for checking or validating an API URL, possibly within a testing environment. The user is prompted for the API endpoint, and the tool attempts to connect. The "TypeError: Load failed" suggests there may be a problem in reaching this URL. The later hint about appending `?class=...` indicates that the user is working with a tool for testing endpoints.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Structure:**

*   The image appears to be a screenshot of a web browser or code editor. It has a dark theme, typical of many coding environments.
*   The top section displays browser controls such as window controls (red, yellow, green buttons), a URL bar, and tabs or related tools.
*   The main area is filled with a JSON formatted data structure.

**Detailed Elements:**

*   **Browser Controls:**
    *   The upper-left has the standard window control buttons (red, yellow, and green circles).
    *   To the right of the controls are a back button (<) and a forward button (>) and the Google logo (G).
    *   A URL bar with "127.0.0.1" displayed.
    *   Tabs or other elements are present at the top of the screen.

*   **Text Content (JSON Data):**
    *   The primary content is a JSON data structure starting with `{"students": [`.
    *   The JSON data appears to be a list of student records.
    *   Each student record is enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
    *   Each student has a `studentId` (an integer) and a `class` (a string, likely representing a class or grade, like "1A").
    *   The student data includes:
        *   studentId 34, class "1A"
        *   studentId 453, class "1A"
        *   studentId 551, class "1A"
        *   studentId 829, class "1A"
        *   studentId 1309, class "1A"
        *   studentId 1795, class "1A"

**Overall Impression:**

The image seems to display a data structure containing student information, possibly loaded in a web browser or a code editor environment. The URL suggests a local server or development environment.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Structure:** The image is a screenshot or a snippet of text that appears to be related to a software or process involving "Llamafile," "ngrok," and a model. It seems to guide the user through a setup and troubleshooting process.

**Text Content:**

*   **Instructions:** The main part of the image provides instructions.  It includes steps such as downloading "Llamafile", running a specific model, and creating a tunnel to the Llamafile server using "ngrok."
*   **ngrok URL Prompt:** There's a question asking for the "ngrok URL," which would be the URL generated by ngrok to allow external access to the Llamafile server. It shows an example format as well:  `https://[random].ngrok-free.app/`
*   **Error Message:**  A prominent error message is displayed after the prompt for the ngrok URL. It reads: `Error: Response is not valid JSON: error code: 524`.

**Specific Objects/Features:**

*   **URLs (Hyperlinks):**
    *   The text contains URLs, with some underlined, indicating they are likely hyperlinks, for example: "Llamafile" and "ngrok".
    *   An example of a generic ngrok URL structure is presented.
    *   The image provides a specific ngrok URL:  `https://02f4-2402-e280-3e32-27f-4b0-6f91-4275-52f3.ngrok-free.app`. This specific URL is displayed in a box that appears to be a field for user input or output.
*   **Error Display:** The error message is displayed in red, highlighting its importance.

**Possible Interpretations and Context:**

*   The image is likely a guide or a part of a setup procedure for running a model (perhaps an AI model) using "Llamafile".
*   "ngrok" is used to expose the Llamafile server to the internet, allowing access from external sources.
*   The user likely encountered an error during the process, with the "Response is not valid JSON" message indicating an issue with the data format the server is returning. The error code "524" likely provides more details about the specific problem.
*   The image is likely a troubleshooting step of the procedure.

**Image Description:** The image displays a Python code execution environment, likely Google Colab or a similar platform.  Here's a breakdown:

**1. Code:**

*   The code imports several libraries: `numpy` (as `np`), `PIL.Image`, `google.colab.files`, and `colorsys`.
*   It uses `google.colab.files.upload()` to allow a user to upload an image.
*   It then opens the uploaded image using `PIL.Image.open()`.
*   The image is converted to a NumPy array and normalized by dividing by 255.0.
*   It calculates the lightness of each pixel using a custom function which uses the `colorsys.rgb_to_hls` function and `np.apply_along_axis` to apply it to the pixel color information.
*   It counts the number of pixels with a lightness value greater than 0.219.
*   Finally, it prints the number of pixels with high lightness.

**2. Execution Status:**

*   There's a green checkmark and the text "8s" in the top left, indicating that the code has finished execution and took 8 seconds to complete.

**3. Output and Upload Information:**

*   Below the code, there is output related to file uploading and the result.
*   The "Choose Files" button is visible, indicating the user has the option to upload a file.
*   The filename "lenna.webp" is listed.
*   There is information about the file "lenna.webp (image/webp)" including its size (14820 bytes) and last modified date (1/30/2025).
*   The saving of the uploaded file to a local file is shown, `lenna.webp to lenna (1).webp`.
*   The final line of the output shows the result: "Number of pixels with lightness > 0.219: 248985".

**In summary:** This is a Python script designed to analyze the lightness of pixels in an image. The code uploads an image, calculates lightness based on the RGB values, and outputs the number of pixels exceeding a certain lightness threshold. The environment suggests a user interface like Google Colab where the code is run and file uploading/downloading is supported.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Structure:**

*   The image depicts a coding environment or a coding execution output, likely within a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. The dark background and the code snippets with syntax highlighting strongly suggest a programming context.

**Code Content:**

*   **Imports:** The code starts with a series of import statements, indicating the use of several Python libraries:
    *   `numpy` (aliased as `np`): For numerical operations, likely array manipulation.
    *   `PIL (Pillow)`: For image processing, specifically the `Image` module for opening and handling image files.
    *   `google.colab import files`: To use google colab file manager.
    *   `colorsys`: For color space conversions.
*   **File Upload:** `uploaded = files.upload()` : This indicates the code is using the user's local file system to upload a file to Google Colab.
*   **Image Loading:**
    *   `image = Image.open(list(uploaded.keys())[0])`: This opens an uploaded image file using the Pillow library. The code retrieves the first key from the uploaded files dictionary to get the filename.
*   **Image Processing:**
    *   `rgb = np.array(image) / 255.0`: Converts the image into a NumPy array, normalizes its color values to be between 0 and 1.
    *   `lightness = np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: colorsys.rgb_to_hls(*x)[1], 2, rgb)`:  This line calculates the lightness of each pixel in the image using the `colorsys` module's `rgb_to_hls` function. The `lambda` function is an inline function which converts each RGB value to HLS and extracts the `lightness` value at index 1.
    *   `light_pixels = np.sum(lightness >= 0.219)`: Calculates the number of pixels in the image with a lightness value greater than or equal to 0.219.
*   **Output:**
    *   `print(f'Number of pixels with lightness > 0.219: {light_pixels}')`: Prints the calculated number of light pixels.

**Execution Output/Status:**

*   The image shows the text `8s` and a green checkmark to the upper left, indicating the code has finished execution.
*   **File Upload Section:** The bottom portion confirms that a file named "lenna.webp" (likely an image) has been uploaded and gives file size and a date: "1/30/2025". Also, it appears the image "lenna.webp" is being saved with the name "lenna (1).webp"
*   **Final Output:** "Number of pixels with lightness > 0.219: 248985" is the result of the code's execution, showing the number of light pixels in the loaded image.

**Overall, the image shows a Python program that loads an image, converts it to HLS color space, and counts the number of pixels with a lightness value above a certain threshold.**

## Post #110 by 23f3002537 (Post ID: 587945)
I think in Q.6 its some error in your code’s logic its unable to fetch the data from your code(Even I tried your URL and its just a black page). Make sure your link is working correctly(giving json response) by pasting it to the browser.


In Q9. I have created dictionary of given data. You can check the for format in the given codes just above the question.(see Test with curl api)

## Post #111 by 23f3002537 (Post ID: 587948)
I think your code logic seem to be correct but it may be because u have downloaded twice the same image and in your output lenna.webp is saving to lenna(1).webp.

Try to do it again after deleting those images which are already downloaded!

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Impression:** The image appears to be from a tutorial or an interactive tool, likely related to testing or interacting with an API (Application Programming Interface) built with FastAPI. It's presenting a scenario where a request to an API URL fails and providing information about the expected response format.

**Key Elements and their Details:**

*   **Title/Instruction:**
    *   "What is the API URL endpoint for FastAPI? It might look like:" (This phrase sets up the context.)
*   **API URL Input/Display:**
    *   A rectangular input field displaying the URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`
    *   The field is highlighted in red, suggesting an issue or error. An "!" icon in a circle is visible on the right, further signaling a problem.
*   **Error Message:**
    *   "Error: Response undefined does not match expected" (This indicates that the response received from the API doesn't meet the expected format.)
*   **Expected Response Format (Data):**
    *   A list of JSON-like objects enclosed in square brackets.  Each object appears to represent a student. Example: `["studentId":57,"class":"5N"]`
    *   The list includes several such objects, each containing a `"studentId"` key (likely an identifier) and a `"class"` key (likely the student's class).
*   **Instruction (Request Modification):**
    *   "We'll check by sending a request to this URL with ?class=... added and check if the response matches the data." This implies the user is expected to add a query parameter `?class=...` to the URL, and the tool/system will then check the API response.

**Context and Purpose:**

*   This is likely part of a learning module, a coding exercise, or a testing framework.
*   The user's task is probably to learn how to make a request to an API with query parameters and how to interpret the response.
*   The error message and expected response help the user understand the correct data format for a successful request.
*   The tool likely expects the user to modify the URL with a valid class name and make a GET request.

In essence, the image presents a situation where an API request failed, and the prompt instructs the user how to make the request.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/8/4/847ae4366a7472bd37099dcb0d2136c6f700cff5_2_690x93.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows the output of a web API call displayed in a web browser. Here's a breakdown:

1.  **URL:** The address bar shows the URL used to make the API call: `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W`.  This suggests a local server running on port 8000, and it's an API endpoint that accepts "class" as a parameter and is requesting data based on different class values, including 5N, 1T, 11P, and 9W.

2.  **"Pretty-print"**:  This text suggests that the response is formatted for readability, a common feature in web browser development tools.

3.  **JSON Response:**  The main content is a list (or array) of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects.  Each object represents a student, and contains:
    *   `studentId`:  An integer representing the student's ID.
    *   `class`: A string representing the student's class. The values for the classes are consistent with the URL parameters.  The classes listed are: "SN", "1T", "11P", and "9W".

**In summary:** The image displays a formatted JSON response from an API, which provides student information (ID and class) filtered by specific class names. The response appears to be the result of a query made through a web browser to a local server.

Hi 
@daksh76
, Can you mention exact error or problem that you are facing.

---

## Post #120 by Jivraj (Post ID: 588064)
The issue might be with the IP address you’re using. Try using 
127.0.0.1
 and check if it’s the correct localhost IP for your machine. Also, test with 
http://localhost:8000/api
 to see if it works.


If that doesn’t solve the problem and you’re running port 8000 inside a virtual machine, use the 
ipconfig
 command to check the correct IP address.


We usually address doubts at the end of every session. Our next session is on the 31st—you can join then and ask your question if none of above solutions works.

**Image Description:** The image shows a web browser's developer tools displaying network activity and data. Let's break down the details:

**Left Side:**

*   **"Pretty-print"**: This suggests the displayed content is formatted for readability.
*   **Data Structure**: The main content is a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) array enclosed in square brackets (`[]`). Inside the array are multiple objects, each representing student data, shown as key-value pairs in curly braces (`{}`). Each object contains a "studentId" and a "class" key.
*   **Student Data**: The data shows various `studentId` values and associated `class` values. The `class` values include strings like "5N", "1T", "11P", and "9W".

**Top of the Browser Window (Address Bar):**

*   **URL**: The address bar displays the URL "127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W". This indicates a local server running on port 8000, likely an API endpoint that accepts the class parameters to retrieve student data.

**Right Side: Developer Tools**

*   **Tabs**:  The developer tools show the "Network" tab is selected.  Other tabs like "Elements," "Console," "Sources," "Performance," and "Memory" are available.
*   **Network Activity**: The "Network" tab displays a table that includes the network requests.
*   **Request Information**: The image shows one request (api?class=SN&class=1T&class=11P&c...), its status is 200 (OK), the type is "document," the initiator is "Other," the size is 694 B, and the time taken is 12 ms.
*   **Filters**:  Above the network request list are filters.
*   **Issues**: There is an "Issues" tab open. It provides a warning: "A form field element should have an id or name attribute".

**Overall Context**

The image captures a developer's inspection of data returned from an API. The developer is likely querying a local API to get student data based on the classes. The pretty-printed JSON shows the data, and the network tab shows details of the API request. The "Issues" tab reveals a potential accessibility concern or development best practice not being met by the code.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Layout:**

The image is a screenshot of a web browser's developer tools, specifically the "Console" panel. On the left side, there is output displayed as "Pretty-print". The right side is dedicated to the developer tools themselves.

**Left Side (Output Display):**

*   **Content:** The primary content on the left is a "Pretty-print" JSON data structure. The data seems to be an array of objects, each object representing a student. The objects have two keys: "studentId" (which holds an integer) and "class" (which holds a string representing the class of the student).

*   **Structure:** The data is formatted with line breaks to enhance readability.

*   **Data Example:** A sample of the output shows entries like: `{"studentId":57, "class":"SN"}` and `{"studentId":67, "class":"1T"}`. This reveals that student IDs are being listed and classes are being assigned.

**Right Side (Developer Tools):**

*   **Panel:** The developer tools are open and show the "Console" tab active, which is typically used for displaying JavaScript logs, errors, and other information.

*   **Tools:** The console area shows common control features such as "Elements", "Console", "Sources", "Network", "Performance", "Memory" and the filtering functionality

*   **Console Controls:** The top part of the developer tool contains controls like a "top" drop-down, a filter box, and other buttons that enable a filter feature.

*   **Issues Panel:** There is an "Issues" tab at the bottom of the developer tools which suggests there is one issue reported. There is an option to group by kind and there is an option to include third-party cookie issues. The message within the issue tab states "A form field element should have an id or name attribute".

**URL and Browser Context:**

*   **URL:** The browser's address bar at the top shows the URL `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=SN&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W`. This indicates a local server (likely a development environment) is running and being accessed via an API endpoint, with parameters for "class" filtered.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:** The image seems to be a screenshot of instructions or a guide related to deploying a Python application on Vercel. It includes text, code snippets, and a URL, along with an error message.

**Key Elements and Details:**

*   **Instructions/Context:** The primary focus of the image is providing instructions, starting with a prompt to "Download this" followed by a filename, "q-vercel-python.json." The instructions continue, describing how to create and deploy a Python app to Vercel, specifically for an API endpoint that responds to requests in a certain format (e.g., including parameters for names like "name-X" and "name-Y"). The expected output format (JSON) is given with sample data. The instructions then mention the importance of enabling CORS.
*   **Code Snippet (Example JSON):** A block of text representing a JSON response:
    ```
    "marks" 10 20
    ```
    This seems to illustrate the expected format of the data returned by the API.
*   **Vercel URL Information:** There are instructions on what the Vercel URL should look like, with an example.
*   **Error Message:** Beneath the provided Vercel URL, there is an error message which says "TypeError: Failed to fetch".
*   **Links and Names:** The instructions make use of the following entities:
    *   vercel-python.json (a file to be downloaded)
    *   vercel (a third-party website)

**Potential Purpose and Use Case:**

*   This screenshot likely comes from a tutorial, documentation, or a challenge focused on learning about Python, API creation, web deployment (using Vercel), and handling JSON data. The prompt may be to deploy a specific API and test it to produce results.
*   The error message suggests that the provided URL might not be working, or the API is having problems fetching data.

**In summary,** this is a guide on how to create and deploy an API on Vercel using Python, with the provided context, JSON, and error message.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/9/c/9cf827a80b0dcb297fa052431b260b5bddc5bbbf.png)

**Image Description:** The image is a screenshot of a web browser displaying a JSON response. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Browser Tabs:** The browser has multiple tabs open. Some of the tabs appear to be related to web development or coding projects, with labels like "tdsproject1", "Deploy Pyn", "Introducing", and possibly related to Vercel (a platform for deploying web applications)
*   **URL:** The active tab displays the URL: "tdsproject1-tjsdp1-2312003853-projects.vercel.app/api?name=sLrAoQ&name=d2KY". This suggests an API endpoint on a Vercel project.
*   **JSON Response:** The main content of the page presents JSON data. It contains the key "marks", which holds an array of two integer values: \[1, 41]. This is the returned result of the API call.
*   **"Pretty-print":** The presence of "Pretty-print" above the JSON data suggests that some sort of formatting or display option has been enabled to make the JSON more readable.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Scene:**

The image captures a screen sharing session, likely a presentation or coding tutorial, taking place within a video conferencing platform. The focus is on a code editor displaying Python code, and a participant named "Saransh" is identified as the presenter.

**Main Content - Code Editor:**

*   The dominant portion of the screen is a code editor, specifically Visual Studio Code (VS Code) based on the layout and features.
*   Two files are open: "fast.py" and "data.csv".
*   The code is Python, and the code appears to be using the FastAPI framework, as indicated by the import or use of "@app.get" and "Query".
*   Lines 15 and 16 appear to be reading data from a CSV file: `data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")` This line suggests that the code is likely importing data using the pandas library and then processing it for use.
*   Lines 18-21 depict a get request to an API and involves defining a function that takes a class name as an argument, and retrieving a population value.

**Video Conferencing Elements:**

*   The video conferencing platform is visible at the bottom of the screen.
*   The screen is overlaid with controls for the meeting, including microphone, camera, and potentially screen sharing controls.
*   A small window in the bottom right shows "Saransh" and a thumbnail of his image, who is presenting.

**Additional Details:**

*   The screen resolution and phone are visible at the top of the image.
*   There are icons that represent notifications from the video conferencing system.
*   A timestamp in the top left indicates it is Jan 31 at 10:31 PM.

**Possible Context:**

This image suggests a coding tutorial or demonstration on using Python and FastAPI to read from a CSV file and build a simple API endpoint. The focus is on data manipulation and API development.

Hi Srividya,


Thats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints.

When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs.


This renders 
name == main
 part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it).


In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You 
do not
 create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2.


This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications.


Thanks for your input.


Kind regards

**Image Description:** The image shows a webpage that appears to be a JSON diff tool. The URL in the browser bar is "jsondiff.com". The webpage is split into two columns, with JSON data displayed in each column.  The JSON data seems to be a list of objects, where each object has two key-value pairs: "class" and "studentID". The values for "studentID" are all numbers.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/3/1/31d574850569f527a4038b80d0171d7b685f9348_2_690x431.jpeg)

**Image Description:** The image shows a web browser window displaying a coding or testing environment. Let's break down the key components:

**Top Bar:**

*   The top bar indicates the title "TDS 2025 Jan GA2".
*   There are several tabs open, including "G docker hub - Google", "exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga2", "localhost:8000/api", and others related to the development process (likely a JSON Diff and a deployment page).
*   It displays "Due Sun, 2 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" with a score of "7.5/10". There are buttons "Check all" and "Save" at the top right.

**Main Content (Coding/Testing Task):**

*   The main area of the page presents instructions or a coding challenge, possibly related to an API.
*   It describes a task involving a query parameter "class" in a URL, specifically for filtering student data.
*   It gives examples like `/api/class=1A` and `/api?class=1A&class=1B`.
*   It emphasizes the need to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) for GET requests.
*   It asks for an API URL endpoint for FastAPI and provides a sample: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`.
*   An error message is present: "Error: Response undefined does not match expected". This suggests that the code is testing the API's response. The expected response format is given (a list of student records).
*   The text ends with instructions to test the URL with "7 class..." and to check if the response matches the expected data.
*   A "Check" button is present.

**Bottom Section (Developer Tools):**

*   This shows the browser's developer tools, specifically the "Network" tab, which is open.
*   There are two requests listed.
*   The content shows HTTP requests to the API (for example, `api/?class=1N&class=8N&class=8X&class=42`).
*   Details about the requests are shown in the "Headers," "Payload," "Preview," "Response," "Initiator," and "Timing" sections.
*   The "Response" section appears to show the JSON data received from the API endpoint.

**In Summary:**

The image documents a student's attempt to test and debug an API endpoint. The coding task involves correctly filtering student data based on class parameters in a URL. The developer tools are being used to inspect the API requests and responses, to identify and resolve errors.

Gentlemen! In GA2 answers, I have a problem.

Question 10, the ngrok tunnel url was once correct and I saved it . When I revisited the GA2 again, the question 10 was marked incorrect.

Do I need to do anything else ?

Secondly the image comression file needs to be reloaded everytime I reconnect to the GA2. When I reload the last saved version, it does not take into the answer already saved.

Third, the url link as given on publishing the page via github is obviously correct. But on checking, even after ?v = 1 …it does not work. Could you kindly look into them and advise if anything else needs to be done at my end? thanks & regards.

*   "Pretty-print" appears to be a button or checkbox, potentially for formatting the JSON output.
*   The main content displayed is the JSON response:
    *   `{"marks": [5,78]}` - This is a JSON object. It contains a key called "marks" whose value is an array containing the numbers 5 and 78. This suggests that some kind of marks or scores are being displayed.

**In Summary:**
The image shows a browser window displaying the result of a web API request. The API is likely hosted on Vercel and is designed to handle requests with "name" parameters. The returned data is a JSON object which contains an array of marks or scores. The presence of several tabs shows that the user has been using other projects, including a project related to "Indian Institute of Technology".

**Image Description:** The image displays a user interface element, likely for testing or validation of a Vercel URL. Here's a breakdown:

**Text:**

*   **Question:** "What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`" This provides context, asking for the correct Vercel URL format. The sample URL indicates a standard structure.
*   **Input Field and Current Value:** `https://new-deploy12345.vercel.app/api` This represents the URL the user has entered or is being tested. It is enclosed in a red outline indicating an error.
*   **Error Message:** "Error: Expected \[98,92,56,72,17] but got \[48, "Not Found", "Not Found", "Not Found", "Not Found"]". This shows the result of the test, indicating a mismatch between the expected values and the results received. The "Not Found" errors suggest the API at the entered URL isn't accessible.
*   **Button:** "Check" This is the action button to initiate the URL validation process.

**Objects:**

*   **Input Field:** A rectangular field where a URL is entered.
*   **Button:** A blue rectangular button labeled "Check".

**Overall Impression:**
The image shows a simple interface where a user is asked to provide a Vercel URL, possibly to test its validity. An error has been returned, indicating the URL is not working as expected, likely because the API isn't accessible or doesn't return the desired data.

Try these 
@21f3000745




Download the data file once again and replace it with your current file, then deploy.


If this doesn’t work, then:


Try clicking on Check button once again. There are few cases where due to duplicity or other problems in the data, this bug occurs. The next check will most probably work.


Reload the page, open the Networks Tab in the Inspect menu, click on Fetch/XHR filter button. Next click on check, if this error prompts up, you will get the request the system sent to check your answer. Copy that request and check on localhost.

**Image Description:** The image is a screenshot of a terminal window, likely from Visual Studio Code, showing the output of a Python application, probably using the FastAPI framework. 

Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

*   **Terminal Window:** The main focus is on the terminal, indicated by the "TERMINAL" tab at the top. The background is dark, and the text is in a lighter color.
*   **Python/FastAPI context:** The title bar says "python3.12-Fastapi", giving us a direct clue about the language and framework.
*   **Output:** The terminal displays several "INFO" messages, likely from a logger in the application. These messages provide information about the application's lifecycle.
*   **File watching:** The first "INFO" indicates the application is watching specific directories for changes, which would automatically reload the server. This path is: `F:\\BS DATA SCIENCE\\Diploma Level\\TERM 2\\TDS\\Week 2\\Fastapi`.
*   **Server Startup:** The log details the startup of Uvicorn (a Python ASGI server) on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. It shows the reloader and server processes starting.
*   **Application Startup:** The message "Application startup complete" confirms that the FastAPI application has initialized.
*   **HTTP Requests and Responses:** The lines after "Application startup complete" show details of HTTP requests and their corresponding responses. Key observations:
    *   `127.0.0.1:53983 - "GET / HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found`: This suggests a request to the root path ("/") returned a "404 Not Found" error.
    *   `127.0.0.1:53983 - "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found`: This indicates a request for the favicon (browser icon) also resulted in a "404 Not Found" error.
    *   `127.0.0.1:53984 - "GET /api HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`:  A request to the `/api` endpoint returned a "200 OK" status, indicating success.
    *   `127.0.0.1:54003 - "GET /api?class=1A HTTP/1.1" 200 OK` and similar: These lines show successful requests to `/api` with a query parameter `class=1A`.
*   **Additional information:** The terminal output indicates the use of the "StatReload" feature, implying that file changes are automatically detected and the server restarts.

In summary, the screenshot demonstrates the successful startup of a FastAPI application and its interactions with HTTP requests, highlighting the server's behavior in response to different endpoints, including some that are not found and others that work correctly.

**Image Description:** The image shows a web browser window displaying JSON data. The URL in the address bar is "127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=1A", suggesting a local server and an API endpoint that accepts a class parameter. The content displayed is a JSON response.

The JSON data represents an array of student objects under the key "students". Each student object has two properties: "studentId" (with integer values such as 224, 226, 750, 1241, 1488, and 1704) and "class" (with the value "1A"). The "Pretty-print" label indicates that the JSON is formatted for readability.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/6/a/6a50cc89a7ecf96749fdfd9f965679452c2b3a54_2_690x225.png)

**Image Description:** The image is a screenshot of a web page describing a task and checking the result. Here's a breakdown:

**1. Task Description:**
*   The main task is to design an API endpoint for fetching students based on class.
*   The API should accept a query parameter named "class".
*   The endpoint should return students in the specified classes.
*   The order of the results should match the order in the CSV file, not the order given in the query.
*   The image mentions enabling CORS to allow GET requests from any origin.

**2. Example URLs:**
*   The example URLs are provided to illustrate how the API should work.
    *   `/api?class=1A` should return only students in class 1A.
    *   `/api?class=1A&class=1B` should return students in both 1A and 1B.

**3. API URL Endpoint:**
*   The page asks for the FastAPI API endpoint, providing an example: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`
*   An input field is shown, the user has input `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`.

**4. Error Message:**
*   The input field has an error message:  `TypeError: Failed to fetch`.  This indicates that the system couldn't successfully retrieve data from the specified API endpoint.

**5. Action to be performed:**
*   The page indicates that a request will be sent to the entered URL with the `?class=...` parameter.
*   The response will be compared with the expected data to check the correctness.

**6. Button:**
*   A blue "Check" button is present at the bottom, which probably initiates the checking process based on the entered URL.

**Image Description:** The image displays a block of text presenting a series of commands related to building, running, and deploying a container using the `podman` tool. The text is formatted as code, with comments indicated by the `#` symbol.

Here's a breakdown of the content:

1.  **Header:**  "To build, run, and deploy the container, run these commands:" This provides context for the subsequent instructions.

2.  **Create an Account and Login:**  Instructions to create an account at `https://hub.docker.com/` and then log in using the `podman login docker.io` command.

3.  **Build and Run the Container:**  Commands to build the container using `podman build -t py-hello .` and then run it with `podman run -it py-hello`.

4.  **Push to Docker Hub:** Instructions and the corresponding command, `podman push py-hello:latest docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello` to push the built container to Docker Hub, replacing `$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME` with the user's Docker Hub username.

5.  **Push with Tagging:** Instructions and command `TAG=dev podman push py-hello docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello:$TAG` to push the container with a specific tag (e.g., "dev") to Docker Hub.  This uses environment variable `$TAG` to define the tag value.

The commands suggest a simple "py-hello" container is being built and deployed. The text emphasizes using `podman` for container operations.  The instructions guide a user through steps to build, run and push a container image to a registry.

Hi 
@24f1002359


For 
Question 10
, ensure that 
all servers are running
 every time you submit (click the 
Save
 button). Since 
ngrok generates a new URL each time it runs
, double-check that the 
ngrok URL is correct
 before submitting.


For 
Question 9
, did you 
enable CORS
? To verify, check your 
browser console
—if CORS is not enabled, you should see an error message indicating the issue.

**Image Description:** The image is a screenshot of the Chrome Developer Tools console.  Here's a breakdown:

**Top Section (Developer Tools Panel):**

*   **Tabs:**  It appears to be a web browser's developer tools interface, with tabs for "Elements", "Console", "Sources", "Network", "Performance", "Memory", and "Application". The "Console" tab is highlighted, indicating it's currently selected.
*   **Toolbar:**  There are standard browser controls like a reload button, and options for filtering and settings.
*   **Dropdowns:**  The "top" dropdown is selected, which usually represents the context, in this case, the top-level document.

**Console Output (Main Content):**

*   **Informational messages:**
    *   "starting ajax request to the resource." (index.html:14)
    *   "ajax request done." (index.html:29)
*   **Error message:**
    *   An error message is present, starting with a red error symbol. It indicates an issue related to cross-origin resource sharing (CORS): "Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://google.com/' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource." (index.html:1)

**Overall Interpretation:**

The screenshot displays a JavaScript console during a web request. The script is making an AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) request to "http://google.com/." However, a CORS error has occurred because the webserver at google.com is not configured to allow requests from the origin where the script is running (which is identified as 'null' in this case, suggesting this request is either being made from a local file or from an origin that is not set up properly). The error message confirms that the server at google.com does not include the required "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header, thus preventing the request from succeeding due to security restrictions. The specific line numbers (e.g., index.html:14) suggest the source file is named index.html, and these numbers point to the locations of the relevant code in that file.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall:**

The image displays a code snippet, likely written in Python, with a syntax highlighting theme that utilizes various colors to distinguish different code elements. It seems to be defining an API endpoint.

**Text and Code Elements:**

*   **`@app.get("/api")`**: This line appears to be a decorator, common in web frameworks.  It is indicating a GET request made to the "/api" endpoint.
*   **`def api(class_: ...`**: This line defines a function named "api." It takes a parameter called "class\_."
*   **`Annotated[list[str] | None, ...`**: The `class_` parameter is type-hinted using the `Annotated` type.  The type of the class\_ parameter can be a `list[str]` or `None`.
*   **`Query(alias='class')`**: A `Query` object is used with `alias='class'`. This indicates the class\_ parameter is retrieved from the query parameters of the GET request, and the query parameter should be named 'class'.
*   **`= None,`**: The parameter "class\_" has a default value of "None."

**Color Highlighting:**

*   Keywords (`def`, `None`, `Query`, `Annotated`) are in blue/cyan.
*   The name "api" is in a yellow color.
*   Strings ("/api," "class") are in orange/red.
*   Types ( `list`, `str` ) are in a cyan color.

**Overall Interpretation:**

The code defines an API endpoint at "/api". This endpoint takes a query parameter named "class" (via the alias). The "class" parameter is a list of strings. If the "class" parameter is not provided in the request, the default value of "None" will be used.

Hi 
@24DS1000121_ULAGAOOZ
 ,


That’s because GitHub protects your email when an external website requests a GitHub Page. To disable this protection, create a 
.nojekyll
 file in your root folder of your repository.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Layout:**

The image shows a split-screen view, likely related to a web development or debugging scenario. The left side displays a webpage with error information, while the right side shows the Chrome Developer Tools, focused on the "Preview" of a specific page.

**Left Side - Error & Question:**

*   **Question:** "What is the GitHub Pages URL? It might look like: `https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/`"  This suggests the user is attempting to identify or solve a problem related to a GitHub Pages site.
*   **Answer & Error:** A specific URL, `https://ulagaoozhian.github.io/TDS-page/` is provided. Underneath this, a red error message appears: "Error: 24ds1000121@ds.study.uitm.ac.in is not in the response:..."  This indicates a problem related to the content retrieved from the provided URL.  Following the error message is an HTML code snippet, likely the content of the page, which shows the basic structure of the HTML, including a heading "My Model Page" and a link with an "email-protected" email address.
*   **Cache Busting Suggestion:** A note at the bottom "If a recent change that's not reflected, add ?v=1, ?v=2 to the URL to bust the cache." This suggests the issue might be due to a browser caching old content.

**Right Side - Chrome Developer Tools:**

*   **Toolbar:** The top section of the developer tools shows the usual Chrome DevTools toolbar.
*   **Tabs:** The "Network" tab is open and shows several tabs like "Headers", "Preview", "Response", "Initiator", and "Timing".
*   **Network Activity:**  The "TDS-page/" entry in the network list is highlighted, indicating the user has selected the network request.
*   **Preview Pane:** The large area to the right shows the "Preview" tab of the selected network request. The preview displays the content of the targeted page. It displays the text "My Model Page" and "Contact me at: [email protected]".
*   **Other Information:** The status information at the bottom of the pane shows 1 request, 0 B transferred, and a "61".

**Overall Context:**

The image seems to be from an assessment or tutorial related to web development. The user is trying to access a page from GitHub Pages, likely created by a person whose email address is hidden. However, the page shows an error when trying to reach it in the format that it should be. The browser's developer tools show the content of the page.

**Image Description:** The image displays information about an API and how to use it. Here's a detailed breakdown:

**1. API Overview and Query Parameter:**

*   The text describes an API that can be queried with a `class` parameter.
*   If the `class` parameter is used, the API should return only students belonging to the specified class(es). For instance, `/api?class=1A` returns students in class 1A, and `/api?class=1A&class=1B` returns students from classes 1A and 1B.
*   The order of returned students should match the order in the original CSV data.

**2. CORS Requirement:**

*   The text mentions that CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) needs to be enabled to allow GET requests from any origin. This suggests the API is likely intended to be accessed from a web browser.

**3. FastAPI Endpoint:**

*   The image highlights that the FastAPI API endpoint might look like this: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`

**4. Error Response and Comparison:**

*   A red box contains the URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`, the API address.
*   Below it, a sample error response is given. The response is structured as a JSON list of student objects, each containing a `studentId` and a `class`.
*   The error message indicates that the actual response received from the API does not match the expected response. This suggests a problem with how the API is currently functioning.
*   The expected response is enclosed in square brackets, showcasing the structure of the student data.

**5. Testing Guidance:**

*   The last sentence indicates that to test the API, the user should send a GET request to the URL with `?class=...` added to the URL, with a specific class in mind, to check if the response matches the expected data.

**In summary:** The image provides instructions and feedback on how to interact with an API that retrieves student data based on specified classes. It highlights a problem (mismatched responses) and gives guidance on how to test the API's functionality, by using the `class` parameter.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/c/bc2d0911cafe513e7b673a5c45286d15344a4d33.png)

**Image Description:** The image displays the output of a "pretty-print" function, presumably applied to a JSON-formatted dataset. Here's a breakdown:

**Overall Structure:**

*   The main content is a large block of text formatted like a JSON object. The data is well-formatted with indentation, indicating that it has been processed by a pretty-print tool.
*   The data represents a list of student records. Each record appears to contain a student ID and a class.
*   There's a browser interface visible around the text, implying this is likely the output of a web API endpoint.

**Details within the Data:**

*   The data is enclosed within `{"students": [...]}` indicating that it is a JSON object containing an array/list of "students".
*   Each student is represented as a JSON object in the format `{"studentId": X, "class": "Y"}` where:
    *   `studentId`:  A numerical identifier for the student (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`, etc.).
    *   `class`: A string representing the class the student is enrolled in (e.g., "100", "7K", "2G", "4W", etc.).
*   The data appears to include a large number of student records. The list is long, suggesting a sizable student population.

**Browser Interface:**

*   The URL bar shows `127.0.0.1:8000/api`, which indicates that this is likely a local development or test environment accessing an API endpoint at the address/port specified.
*   There are browser tabs open at the top, along with bookmarks.

In essence, this image shows the JSON representation of student data that has been formatted for readability. This would be common in a web development or data management context, where you want to view and inspect the contents of data retrieved from an API or database.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/9/4/94b68df3490d735ba6fc0a0f57040bd762ed8eef_2_690x387.png)

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image displays a computer screen with a web browser window open, showing the results of a data query. The primary content is a "Pretty-print" formatted JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) response, likely from an API (Application Programming Interface) call.

**Key Features and Elements:**

*   **Web Browser Window:** The majority of the screen is taken up by a web browser window.
    *   **URL:** The URL in the address bar is `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=3Q`. This indicates a local server running on port 8000 and an API endpoint being accessed, with a query parameter `class` set to `3Q`. This suggests the API is designed to retrieve data related to a specific class.
    *   **Tabs:**  Several browser tabs are visible along the top, suggesting the user is actively browsing and working on different projects. The tabs include labels like "Docker", "Create an", "My Dash", "Graded A", "TDS 20", "API Fetch", "Setup -", "GAZ-D", "Bama.cp", "Perplexit", "AI", "CSS50", "Programming", "goodreads.com", "Household Services...", "Hackskill", "Home - Prepare for...", "cse.iitb.ac.in/-gane", "Arcade", "Coding Conquest C...", "NPTEL".
*   **JSON Data:** The core of the content is the JSON data, which is formatted to be readable.  This is the response from the API request.
    *   **Structure:** The JSON data appears to be a list of student records, enclosed in curly braces and square brackets.
    *   **Key-Value Pairs:**  Within the JSON, there are key-value pairs describing student attributes. It looks like the primary keys are "studentId" and "class".
    *   **Values:** The values associated with "studentId" are numerical, representing student identifiers. The values associated with "class" are always "3Q".
*   **"Pretty-print":** The term "Pretty-print" is present above the JSON data, suggesting that the data is formatted for readability.
*   **Operating System:**
    *   **Taskbar:** At the very bottom of the screen, there is a taskbar.
    *   **System Information:** The taskbar shows the temperature (15°C), CPU and GPU utilization percentage, RAM usage percentage (97%), a search box, and the current time (22:46) and date (02-02-2025).
    *   **Icons:** There are a variety of icons on the taskbar, indicating running applications (e.g., File Explorer, Visual Studio Code, a browser, and some communication or other applications).

**Inferred Context and Possible Questions:**

*   **Purpose:** The user is likely querying a database or system that stores student information, probably related to a course or educational context.
*   **API:** The API being used is designed to return student information, filtered by a specific class.
*   **Development/Testing:** The `127.0.0.1` URL implies the user is working on a local development or testing environment.
*   **JSON Parsing:** The use of "Pretty-print" suggests the user is developing or reviewing the output of the API.

**Potential Questions the Image Could Help Answer:**

*   What's the structure of the student data being retrieved?
*   What is the API endpoint being used?
*   What class is being queried?
*   What student IDs are in the "3Q" class?
*   What is the user currently working on, based on the open tabs?
*   Is the application being tested running locally?

Gentleman,

I dont understand. I just now, on triggering the Github action, I copied the url of my github repository. It worked !

## Post #167 by Saransh_Saini (Post ID: 590015)
The problem is that, if class param is passed, only then it is filtering as usual, but when no param is passed it returns the entire DataFrame, which is not supposed to happen.


If no parameter is passed it should return an empty list.


I suspect you directly copied this code from ChatGPT without understanding, which is acceptable for us, but not very helpful for you.

    *   This is a green-bordered section.
    *   It lists recent save attempts with timestamps and scores. The entries appear to be in reverse chronological order, showing saved work with associated scores:
        *   "Reload from 05/02/2025, 23:12:21. Score: 5.5"
        *   "Reload from 05/02/2025, 23:09:31. Score: 5.5"
        *   "Reload from 05/02/2025, 22:10:01. Score: 2.5"
    *   Each save entry has a "Reload" button, which presumably allows the user to restore a previous version of their work.

**Overall Context:**

The image likely shows the end result of an assessment or a test where the user is working on an assignment within a web-based platform. The user has likely finished the task (as indicated by the "Ended at" timestamp) and is able to see his score. It shows saved versions of the work with associated scores, which could be useful for review.
