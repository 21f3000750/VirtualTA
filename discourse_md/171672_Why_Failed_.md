**Image Description:** This image shows an email or automated report detailing the results of a project evaluation.  The email is addressed to a "Dear Learner" and concerns "Project 1".

The core content explains that the project requires passing several pre-requisite checks, detailed on a separate "TDS Project 1: Evaluation" page.  Five specific checks are listed:

1.  GitHub repository existence and public accessibility.
2.  Presence of a LICENSE file with an MIT license in the GitHub repository.
3.  Presence of a valid Dockerfile in the GitHub repository.
4.  Public accessibility of the Docker image and its functionality via a `podman run` command (with placeholders for token and image name).
5.  The Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as the GitHub repository.

The email then presents the evaluation results for these checks.  Three checks passed ("PASS"): the Docker image's presence and public status on Dockerhub, the GitHub repository's presence and public status, and the Dockerfile's presence in the repository. However, one check failed ("FAIL"): the MIT license was not found in the GitHub repository's root.

Because of this failure, the overall "Prerequisites" status is marked as "FAIL", and the "Project 1 Score" is 0.  This suggests that project submission will not be evaluated until the missing MIT license is added.

I checked your github repo MIT License file is named as 
Licenese.md
 but standard naming for License is LICENSE or LICENSE.md (with all caps).

**Image Description:** This image is a screenshot of a GitHub Docs page detailing how to add a license to a repository.  The page is predominantly dark-themed.

The top shows a browser address bar with the URL  `https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a...`, indicating the webpage's location within GitHub's documentation.  The browser's title bar also displays "GitHub Docs" and a dropdown menu for selecting the version (Free, Pro, & Team).

The main content focuses on a step-by-step guide with numbered instructions (3-6) highlighted:

* **Step 3:**  Instructs the user to type `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md` (all caps) in the file name field.

* **Step 4:**  Directs the user to click the "Choose a license template" button after entering the file name.  A screenshot of this step shows the file path `octo-repo/LICENSE` in an input field, with "Choose a license template" highlighted.

* **Step 5:** Describes how to select a license from the available options on the left-hand side of the page, under the "Add a license to your project" section.

* **Step 6:**  Indicates that the user should click "Review and submit" to finalize the process.

Above the numbered instructions, there are screenshots of the GitHub interface:

* One shows a file explorer-like view with folders named `devcontainer` and `github`.  The plus sign indicates the creation of a new file.

* Another screenshot shows a GitHub file details view, with file name, last commit message, and last commit date information.

In the top right corner, a "Search GitHub" button is visible. To the far right, there's a section titled "In this article" with subsections "Including an open sou..." and "Further reading." The ellipsis suggests truncated text.

So, should I edit the filename now, or will you count it as missing?

I submitted the project 
within the deadline
, and I ensured that 
all requirements were fulfilled
, including correctly adding the MIT License file. The license file was named properly and contained the correct content.


However, I received a message stating that the MIT License was not present, and that the prerequisites were not completed — resulting in a failed status. This is surprising and feels unfair, as I’ve double-checked my submission and confirmed that everything, including the license file, is in place and named correctly.


Here is my GitHub repo for your reference: 
GitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1


I kindly request a re-evaluation of my submission, as I believe I’ve met all the required criteria. I would really appreciate your time in looking into this matter again.


Thank you for your understanding.

**Image Description:** The image shows a portion of a commit history, likely from a version control system like Git.  Each section represents a set of commits grouped by date.  The information displayed for each commit includes:

* **Date:** The date the commit was made (Apr 3, 2025; Feb 17, 2025; Feb 15, 2025).

* **Commit Message:** A brief description of the changes made in the commit (e.g., "Rename License.md to LICENSE.md," "Update License.md").

* **Author:** The username of the person who made the commit ("virajpitale").  A small icon is also displayed next to the username.

* **Verification Status:** A green "Verified" label appears next to some commits.  This suggests a verification process has been completed for those commits.

* **Commit Hash (SHA):** A short unique identifier for the commit (e.g., "d62d2ee", "7624006").

* **Other Icons:** Several small icons are present but their meaning isn't clear from just the image.  One likely represents viewing the changes in the commit.

The overall context suggests that the user "virajpitale" made several changes to files related to the project's licensing and README documentation.  The commits show a consistent evolution in the file names and contents, culminating in the final version.  The "project" commit suggests a separate, smaller commit within the Feb 15th set.
