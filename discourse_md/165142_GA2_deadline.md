I wanted to seek clarification regarding the deadline for GA2. The latest email received today mentions the deadline as 26th January, whereas an earlier email stated 2nd February, which is also reflected on the dashboard.


Could you please confirm the correct deadline to avoid any confusion?

**Image Description:** This is an email notification, likely from an academic institution. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Sender Email:** donot_reply@study.iitm.ac.in  This suggests an automated system, not intended for direct replies.  The "iitm.ac.in" domain hints at an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras.

* **Recipient:** The email was sent to the mailing list 25t1_se2002-announce, indicating a specific course or group of students (likely a semester or section).

* **Subject/Body:** The email informs the recipients about the deadline for a graded assignment.  It specifically mentions:

    * **Assignment:** Week 1 & 2 Graded Assignment.
    * **Deadline:** 26/01/2025 23:59 Hrs. (January 26th, 2025, at 11:59 PM).

* **Closing:** A standard closing, "Warm Regards," followed by "IITM BS Team" suggests the sender is the administrative team of a Bachelor of Science (BS) program at IIT Madras.

* **Timestamp:** The email was sent at 12:23 PM, seven minutes before the screenshot was taken.


In short, the image shows an automated email announcing the deadline for a graded assignment to a specific group of students in a BS program at IIT Madras.
