Hello,


I submitted my graded assignment for TDS course. But unfortunately I did not see the question in the portal asking if I have seen all questions and attended the exam. Can someone please clarify if it shall be graded still?

It is saying you did not attempt it because you did not answer the seek portal question.


You are not graded on the seek portal question. It only exists to make sure you saw the GA and attempted it. You are only graded on your submission of GA1 on the actual assignment page where your last saved submission is used for grading.


Kind regards

Dear Sir,

I encountered the same issue as mentioned. Could you please confirm whether GA 1 will still be evaluated under this condition, and if we will receive our actual score based on the last saved submission on the assignment page?

Hello,

I accessed the assignment through the provided link and attempted and saved it. But unfortunately I forgot to submit it on my course LMS. I have put in a lot of effort to complete this and I scored 9,  so I kindly request you to consider it and provide your clarification on the matter.

## Post #7 by 23f2005471 (Post ID: 586663)
Respected Sir,

I made the similar mistake of not selecting a yes on the seek IITM portal

According to your previous replies, does it imply that only the answers submitted through the link provided will be considered for evaluation regardless of the seek portal selection for this time?

Thanks

Correct! Only scores that were saved in your actual last submission on the ga page itself will be evaluated (the portal question is just to make sure you were aware of the GA and confirm that you attempted it).

Dear 
@s.anand
 sir,

For the TDS week 1 assignment, I have submitted it in the link (this link) that was mentioned in the graded assignment but I did not submit yes in the portal tab. Can you please help me out this one time??


I will make sure I submit it in both places next time.


I kindly request you to help me out this one time, as this will really impact my grade particularly as of this course.

I got a total of 9.5 in this assignment but as you can see in the image attached below I erred up with this submission

**Image Description:** [Image analysis : Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout and Design:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a dark-themed online assessment or learning platform. The top portion has a red header, while the main body is dark gray with teal accents.

**Textual Elements:**

*   **Header:** "Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" indicating a deadline.
*   **Instructions/Rules:**
    *   "5. Browser may struggle. If you face loading issues, turn off security restrictions or try a different browser."
    *   "6. Use anything. You can use any resources you want. The Internet, ChatGPT, friends, whatever. Use any libraries or frameworks you want."
    *   "7. It's hackable. It's possible to get the answer to some questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That's allowed."
*   **Advice:** "Should you take TDS this term?"
    *   "If this assignment takes you under 2 hours to complete, you will likely do OK in TDS."
    *   "If you score above 8 / 10, you might get an S or A grade, with effort and luck."
*   **Question/Discussion Prompt:** "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse." (accompanied by a chat bubble icon)
*   **Login Information:** "You are logged in as 23f1002223@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." A link for "Logout" is also present.
*   **Recent Saves:** Display of recent saves: "Reload from 1/26/2025, 11:59:45 PM. Score: 9.5" is listed three times.

**Graphical Elements:**

*   A small red circle with a downward-pointing chevron, likely a drop-down menu or options button in the top right corner.
*   A chat bubble icon next to "Have questions?".
*   Buttons that say "Reload."

**Key Features and Implications:**

*   **Assessment/Quiz:** The content suggests the user is engaged in an online assessment or quiz of some kind.
*   **Flexibility:** The rules clearly state that any resources are allowed for use, including the Internet, AI tools, and even hacking.
*   **Hacking Encouraged?:** The mention of "It's hackable" and "That's allowed" is unusual and implies that examining and manipulating the code is an accepted, perhaps even encouraged, approach.
*   **TDS:** The context of "Should you take TDS this term?" indicates that TDS might be a course or program.
*   **Recent Saves:** The display of recent saves indicates the platform is tracking progress.
*   **Institution:** The email address indicates the user is affiliated with IITM (Indian Institute of Technology Madras).
*   **Score:** The user appears to be doing well with a recent score of 9.5.

In summary, the image shows a screenshot from an online assessment platform where the user is allowed to use all available resources, including hacking the code, to complete a quiz. is not a valid file path.]

 I had made my submission for GA1 on the website and also secured 9/10, image attached as shown. But in the course dashboard i missed out on the trivial step of clicking Yes. Since i am also logged in from my email on the evaluatio website and my score is saved, can iT PLEASE be considered for evaluation.

**Image Description:** [Image analysis : The image appears to be a screenshot of an online assignment submission, possibly from a learning management system.

Here's a breakdown of the content:

**Top Section:**

*   A dark-colored box displays multiple submissions (probably attempts at the same assignment).
*   Each submission is labeled with "Reload" followed by:
    *   Date and Time: For example, "1/26/2025, 12:25:43 PM".
    *   Score: Numbers like "9", "8.5", "8".

**Middle Section:**

*   "image" with an edit icon indicates this is potentially an embedded image or document.
*   A comment that is a request: "I have attempted the assignment and also saved my score, but I forgot to just click yes on the other portal, can you please allow this submission to be evaluated?"
*   A notice in bold emphasizes the requirement to use the Student ID in a specific format (e.g., "22f3xxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in") for the graded assignment. Failure to do so will result in the score not being considered for evaluation.

**Bottom Section:**

*   A question with radio button options: "1) I have seen the Graded Assignment 1 available at this link and have attempted it."
    *   Options: "Yes", "No"
*   The answer given ("No") is marked as incorrect.
*   The current Score is 0.
*   The accepted answer is listed as "Yes".

**Overall:**

It seems a student made a mistake in submitting their assignment, specifically failing to confirm they had seen and attempted the assignment by not clicking "Yes". They are requesting special consideration. is not a valid file path.]

It is saying you did not attempt it because you did not answer the seek portal question.

**Image Description:** [Image analysis : The image shows a web page interface for a quiz or test. The page is split into three main sections.

At the top, in a red bar, it says "Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST". The current score is "Score: 0", and there are "Check" and "Save" buttons next to the score.

Below this, there is a light green "Recent saves" section. This section shows the history of saves with timestamps. The first entry shows "Loaded from 1/26/2025, 11:51:50 PM. Score: 6". The following two entries are "Reload from 1/26/2025, 11:44:51 PM. Score: 5.5" and "Reload from 1/26/2025, 11:44:00 PM. Score: 5.5"

Hi Mandy,


Your scores will be pushed to the Dashboard from your saved submissions. Ignore the seek Portal result (that was a placeholder question to make students aware that GA had been released).

**Image Description:** [Image analysis : The image shows a screen capture of a web interface, likely an online coding assessment or learning platform. Here's a detailed breakdown:

**Top Section:**

*   **URL:** The URL in the address bar is "exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-gal". This suggests a subdomain of "sanand.workers.dev" for exams, possibly related to a company or organization called "Sanand". The "tds-2025-01-gal" likely refers to a specific test or module.
*   **Due Date:**  The text "Due Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" indicates the deadline for the task is Sunday, January 26, 2025, at 11:59 PM Indian Standard Time (IST).
*   **Score:**  "Score: 10/10" means the current submission has achieved a perfect score of 10 out of 10.
*   **Buttons:** There are "Check" and "Save" buttons, suggesting functionality to check the solution and save progress.

**Coding Area:**

*   **SQL Query:** There's a code box containing an SQL query:
    ```sql
    FROM tickets
    WHERE LOWER(TRIM(type)) = 'gold';
    ```
    This query selects data from a table named "tickets". The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only rows where the "type" column, after being trimmed of leading/trailing spaces (`TRIM`) and converted to lowercase (`LOWER`), is equal to "gold".

**Instructions and Feedback:**

*   **Correct:** The word "Correct" indicates that the submitted code is deemed correct.
*   **Instruction Text:** Below "Correct," there's a description of the problem: "Get all rows where the Type is 'Gold'. Ignore spaces and treat mis-spellings like GOLD, gold, etc. as 'Gold'. Calculate the sales as Units".  This elaborates on the task and explains how to handle variations in the "Type" column.

**Submission Information:**

*   **"Submitted"**: The text "Submitted" confirms that the work has been submitted.
*   **Warning Message:**  A message reads, "If you submit again, it will overwrite your previous submission and score."  This warns the user about resubmitting.
*   **Save Reminder:**  Finally, it says, "Save regularly. Your last saved submission will be evaluated." This encourages regular saving.

In summary, the image depicts a completed coding assignment on a web platform. The task involved writing an SQL query to retrieve data from a "tickets" table based on the "type" column, with specific instructions on handling variations in the "type" value. The user has achieved a perfect score and submitted the assignment. is not a valid file path.]
