The deadlines mentioned in the Grading Document provided and the TDS website (
s-anand.net
) are different. Project-1’s deadline was 15 Feb, it was then postponed to the 16th of Feb. Can this be reflected here?

Not affecting me particularly, however, it’s good to be consistent across channels of communication to the students…

### Image Insight:

**Image Description:** This image contains a syllabus or schedule for a "Tools in Data Science" course (Diploma in DS).  The key information includes:

* **Course Components:** The course involves weekly assignments (GAA), a remote online exam (ROE1), two take-home projects (P1 and P2), and a final end-term exam (F).

* **Assessment Details:**  A table outlines the assessment names, open dates, submission dates, and peer review dates for ROE1, P1, and P2.  Specific dates and times are provided in the table, using IST (presumably India Standard Time).  The assessments are described as having open internet access (except the final exam which is in-person and has no internet access).

* **Eligibility:**  To attend the end-term exam, students need an average of at least 40 out of 100 across their best two weekly assignment scores.  Attending the end-term exam is required to obtain a final course grade.

* **Grading:**  A formula is provided at the bottom for calculating the final course score (T):  `T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2P2 + 0.25F`.  This demonstrates the weighting given to each component of the course.  There is a previous formula with different weighting included that has been crossed out.  P1 and P2 each have two components (submissions and peer reviews) with an 80:20 weighting.

* **Important Dates:**  The end-term exam is scheduled for April 13th, 2025.  Other important dates (open and submission dates) for assignments and the ROE1 are specified in the table.


In short, the image provides a comprehensive overview of the assessment schedule, grading criteria, and eligibility requirements for a data science course.
