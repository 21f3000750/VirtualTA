**Image Description:** The image is a multiple-choice question. The question number is 307 and the question ID is 6406531045319. The question type is Multiple Choice Question (MCQ). It has a correct mark of 1.

The question asks: "Which of the following methods is best for identifying if a log entry's timestamp corresponds to a Saturday? (timestamp is a method in datetime library)".

There are four options given:
1. 6406533529040. Check if timestamp.weekday() == 5 (marked incorrect)
2. 6406533529041. Check if timestamp.weekday() == 6 (marked correct)
3. 6406533529042. Check if timestamp.strftime('%A') == 'Saturday' (marked incorrect)
4. 6406533529043. Check if timestamp.dayname() == 'Saturday' (marked incorrect)

The correct answer is option 2, which checks if `timestamp.weekday() == 6`. The incorrect answers are marked with a red "x" and the correct answer is marked with a green check. The options are written in monospace font.
