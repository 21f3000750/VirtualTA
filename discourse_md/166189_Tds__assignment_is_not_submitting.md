    We have removed that button, cause it was causing confusion among the students. 
If you have saved your answers on the TDS portal then you need not worry, you will be marked. The button was just there to ensure you saw the assignment on the TDS portal.

TDS TA

Your scores are evaluated on a site that is external to the seek portal and is not integrated with the seek portal. Therefore seek does not know if you have submitted or not and by default says that it has not been submitted because it cannot see your external evaluation. There will not be a fix for this for some time.


Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal.


The scores will only be visible in the dashboard.
 Just ignore anything inside seek portal. The dashboard is where all your subject score cards exists.


As stated in multiple places on discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission. If your dashboard score does not match your final submission score on the assignment page, only then contact us regarding your marks.


Kind regards

Screenshot (313)
1920×1080 243 KB

### Image Insight:
![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/d/5/d51f4ef2faa1d935371f7b95e9d49a85435b481d_2_690x388.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a computer screen displaying a web page for a graded assignment.  Let's break down the key elements:

**Top Section:**

* **Browser Tab:** The browser tab shows the title "Graded Assignment 3: TM", indicating the subject of the assignment.  The URL `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga3` points to the assignment's location. Other tabs suggest the user is also working with email and other applications.  The time displayed in the lower right corner indicates the date and time the screenshot was taken.

* **Red Banner:** A red banner across the top declares "Ended at Wed, 5 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST". This indicates the assignment's deadline has passed.  A "Score: 0" is displayed, meaning the user's score at the time of screenshot was zero.  Buttons for "Check all" and "Save" are present.


* **Instructions:** Below the banner, numbered instructions are provided:
    * Instruction 5 advises users to try different browsers or disable security restrictions if loading problems occur.
    * Instruction 6 explicitly permits use of any resources, including the internet, ChatGPT, or any libraries/frameworks.
    * Instruction 7 states that "hacking" the code to obtain answers is allowed.
    * A note clarifies that multiple servers will be used and that all must be running while checking or saving answers.


* **Discourse Link:** A light-blue box contains a link inviting users with questions to join a discussion on Discourse.


* **Login Information:** The user is logged in as `23f3004066@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. A "Logout" button is available.


* **Recent Saves:** A section titled "Recent saves" displays three entries, each showing a "Reload" button and timestamp of saves, all from February 1st, 2025, along with a score of 8 for each.


* **Questions Section:** A partially visible section labeled "Questions" suggests that the main part of the assignment is below (cutoff by the bottom edge of the screenshot). A search bar is visible.


**Overall:**  The image shows a graded assignment that appears to be unusually open-ended, encouraging students to use any means to complete it (even "hacking" the code).  The fact the deadline has passed and a zero score is shown suggests the user didn't complete or submit the assignment before the deadline. The presence of recent saves with high scores suggests previous attempts were made. The screenshot also reveals that the user has a multi-tab browser environment.

Dear Bhavanagv,


The scores have not been pushed to the dashboard yet. Ignore seek portal. Seek portal will not have your submission or your scores because it is evaluated externally from the seek portal.


Kind regards

**Image Description:** The image shows a dark-green box containing a list of recent saves.  The title "Recent saves" is at the top.

Below the title are three entries, each containing:

* **A "Reload" button:** This suggests the user can reload a previous game state.
* **A date and time:** All three entries show the same date (2/2/2025) but slightly different times (9:04:58 PM, 9:04:53 PM, and 9:04:51 PM). This indicates multiple saves made within a short timeframe.
* **A score:** All three entries have a score of 4, suggesting a consistent score across those save points.

A small red dot is visible to the left of the top "Reload" button.  This could be an indicator of the currently selected item, or some other interface element.  The overall style suggests a game's in-game interface or menu.

There are some errors in grading for GA2 and  GA3 for TDS, even after submitting the assignments score 0 was given and the seek portal displayed assignment was not submitted given that the login was from my own account and was submitted before the time and still got a score of 0.

and the same happened for the 3rd assignment

**Image Description:** This image shows a screen capture of an online exam or quiz interface.  Here's a breakdown of the content:

**Header:**

* **"Ended at Wed, 5 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST Score: 0"**: This indicates the exam ended on February 5th, 2025, at 11:59 PM IST (Indian Standard Time), and the current score is 0.
* **"Check all" and "Save"**: These are buttons likely used to submit answers or save progress.

**Instructions:**

A numbered list provides clear instructions for the exam-taker:

1.  Learn the material or skip it as needed.
2.  Check answers frequently using the "check" button.
3.  Save answers frequently using the "save" button.
4.  Reloading the page is allowed; answers are saved client-side.
5.  Address browser issues by adjusting settings or changing browsers.
6.  Any resources are permitted (Internet, AI, etc.).
7.  "Hacking" the quiz code to find answers is explicitly allowed.

A note clarifies that multiple servers will be running concurrently during the exam. A link invites users to join a discussion forum ("Discourse") for questions.

**Login Information:**

* **"You are logged in as 23f2000232@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"**:  This shows the user's login email address, suggesting a student or academic context (possibly Indian Institute of Technology Madras).
* **"Logout"**: A button to end the session.

**Recent Saves:**

A section displays a history of saved progress:

* **"Recent saves (most recent is your official score)"**: The most recent saved attempt determines the final score.
* Three entries detail the timestamps and scores of previous submissions.

In summary, this is a screenshot of a uniquely open and potentially technical exam with unusually permissive rules regarding resource utilization and even code manipulation. The use of multiple servers suggests a robust and possibly academically focused environment.

Only 1st Graded assignment scores are visible on dashboard.  I have submitted 2nd and 3rd GA before the deadline but still it showing “not submitted” on the seek portal…

## Post #24 by 21f3000697 (Post ID: 633606)
I recently got mail and checked my marks for GA2 and noticed that the final score is showing as 
4.25
, but while attempting the assignment earlier, I had scored 
7.25
 shown after submission.


Could you please help me understand how the marks were reduced? I want to ensure there was no error or misunderstanding in the evaluation.

Hi Satish,


Your last submitted score is the only valid score. You have to check before submitting that the score is correct. There is a reload button to load previous answers. But some answers require a live service. If the live service is not running at the time of the check (when you hit the submit button), you will not be scored for those questions. Please make sure that you have any live services running when the submit button is used and check that the last saved score is correct.


Kind regards
