**Image Description:** The image shows a dark-themed web page, likely an online exam or quiz platform.  Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Section:**  Displays a login message indicating the user "23f1002630@ds.study.litm.ac.in" is currently logged in. A "Logout" button is also present.

* **Second Section (Green):**  Titled "Recent saves", it states that there are "No recent saves".  The parenthetical note clarifies that the most recent save is considered the official score.

* **Third Section (Teal):** Shows a message "Loading questions..." along with a circular loading indicator (the letter 'C'). This suggests the system is attempting to retrieve exam questions.

* **Fourth Section (Red):**  A prominent error message is displayed: "Error!".  It states that the questions could not be loaded, describes the error as "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '1')", and instructs the user to contact the exam team for assistance.  This indicates a technical problem preventing the exam from loading.

In short, the image depicts a failed attempt to load an online exam.  The error message provides a technical detail that would be useful for debugging, but primarily directs the user to seek support.

@23f1002630
 - thanks for raising this. It’s fixed and won’t re-occur for anyone.


What happened?
 I picked random duration from the video of 10-40 seconds, but forgot to ensure that the end time should not exceed the video length. That’s what I fixed.

**Image Description:** Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a dark-themed interface, likely from an online exam or quiz platform.  It's divided into three distinct sections:

**Section 1 (Top): Recent Saves**

* A dark green box displays the heading "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)".
* Below this, it states "No recent saves", indicating no saved progress.

**Section 2 (Middle): Loading Questions**

* A teal-colored box displays "Loading questions..." along with a circular loading indicator. This suggests the system is attempting to retrieve the exam questions.

**Section 3 (Bottom): Error Message**

* A dark red box shows an error message.  The heading "Error!" is prominently displayed.
* The error message explains: "Sorry, we couldn't load the questions. That's strange."
* A more technical error is provided: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '1')".  This is likely a JavaScript error indicating a programming issue where the system tried to access a property of a variable that wasn't defined.
* Finally, it provides instructions: "Please contact the exam team for assistance."

**Buttons at the Bottom:**

At the very bottom of the interface are two buttons: "Check all" and "Save". These buttons are likely disabled due to the error.

**Overall:** The image clearly displays a critical error preventing the loading of exam questions. The detailed error message suggests a backend programming problem that needs to be addressed by the exam administrators.

OpenRefine question has historically been a tricky question to get right. Check out some past TA sessions in previous term for solving it, or previous discourse posts.

**Image Description:** The image shows a portion of a spreadsheet, likely from a program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.  The spreadsheet displays sales data.

Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Columns:** The visible columns are labeled "city" (A), "product" (B), and "sales" (C).  The column headers are in an orange-ish background, which suggests they might be visually distinguished from the data.

* **Rows:**  The rows contain data related to bacon sales in Sao Paulo (with slight spelling variations in "Sao Paulo").  Each row shows a numerical ID (potentially a transaction ID or index), the city (Sao Paulo, with some inconsistencies in spelling), the product (Bacon), and the sales amount for that specific entry.

* **Data:**  The data suggests that multiple sales transactions of bacon occurred in Sao Paulo.  There are inconsistencies in the spelling of "Sao Paulo" (Sao Paulo, Sao Pualo, Sao Paoulo, Sao Paolo). This is something to consider if data integrity is a concern.

* **Totals:** The bottom row shows a total sales figure of 2871, implying this is a summation of all the "sales" values in the visible range of the spreadsheet.


* **Sorting Indicators:** The column headers ('city', 'product', 'sales') all have small downwards-pointing triangles indicating that the columns may be sortable.


In summary, the image shows a simple sales report focusing on bacon sales in Sao Paulo, highlighting the total sales for the displayed entries,  but with spelling inconsistencies in the city name.  The spreadsheet likely contains much more data beyond what is visible in the image.

Wrong / Confusing question Prof


The top line mentions “Saturdays” whereas the bottom line mentions “Sundays”


Please clarify “SUNDAY” or “SATURDAY”?

**Image Description:** This image contains a document describing a data analysis task.  The task involves analyzing a large Apache web log file (61MB, 258,074 rows) from the website `s-anand.net` for May 2024. The website has a section dedicated to "telugu" content that is particularly popular. The goal is to determine the number of successful GET requests made to the telugu section on Saturdays between 13:00 and 23:00.

The document highlights several key aspects:

* **Data Source:** A GZipped Apache log file containing 258,074 rows.  Each row represents a web server log entry.
* **Data Format:**  The log file is space-delimited, with most fields enclosed in double quotes (`"`).  However, the "Time" field is an exception, and there are 41 rows with inconsistent quoting due to escaped quotes. The data is in the GMT-0500 timezone.
* **Data Fields:** The log file includes fields like IP address, remote logname, remote user, Time, Request (containing Method, URL, and Protocol), Status, Size, Referer, User Agent, Vhost, and Server. The `Request` field is of particular interest as it needs to be parsed into its three components (Method, URL, Protocol).
* **Success Criteria:** A successful request is defined as having an HTTP status code between 200 and 299.
* **Time Window:** The analysis should focus on requests made on Saturdays between 13:00 and before 23:00 (GMT-0500).
* **Request Type:** Only GET requests are considered.
* **Objective:** The analysis should answer the question:  "What is the number of successful GET requests for pages under `telugu` from 13:00 until before 23:00 on Saturdays?"
* **Business Implications:** The results will inform resource scaling, content planning, and marketing strategies.

In short, the image provides a detailed description of a data analysis problem, outlining the data source, its format, and the required steps to arrive at the answer.  The focus is on extracting specific information from a non-standard log file format to answer a business question about website traffic.

Update: I tried for both (thank god for filters in Excel) and Sunday is what the question is asking for. The Instruction above for “Saturday” is incorrect- maybe the logic generating different questions for different students can be tweaked-


Thank you

I’ve attempted this question several times and I’m fairly certain that the answer to this question is incorrect. I’d be grateful if the answer to this question was re-checked. I can share the answer I’m certain about here, however I do not think it would be prudent to do so given this is a public forum.


Please consider my request and double check-

**Image Description:** This image presents a case study detailing a data recovery and analysis task.  The scenario involves ReceiptRevive Analytics, a firm specializing in recovering sales data from damaged paper receipts using OCR.  Their client, RetailFlow Inc., has an archive of digitized receipts with incomplete data due to damage during the digitization process.


The core problem is that the JSON data representing the receipts is truncated, specifically missing the `id` field, a unique identifier for each receipt.  Despite the missing `id`, the task focuses on extracting the `sales` value (representing sales revenue or units sold) from each of the 100 rows of data.


The **task** for the data analyst is threefold:

1. **Parse the Sales Data:** Extract the `sales` figures from the provided JSON file, ignoring the missing `id` field.
2. **Data Validation and Cleanup:** Handle incomplete data entries appropriately, concentrating solely on the `sales` values.
3. **Calculate Total Sales:** Sum the `sales` values across all 100 rows to find the total sales recorded.


The successful completion of this task will allow RetailFlow Inc. to: reconstruct historical sales data, make informed business decisions (inventory, promotions), enhance ReceiptRevive's data recovery processes, and ultimately build client trust.

The image also provides a download link to the `q-parse-partial-json.jsonl` file containing the 100 rows of sales data.  The file is in JSON Lines format.  Each line represents a single sales entry.

**Image Description:** The image shows a spreadsheet-like table with data related to sales and costs.  The table has columns labeled:

* **Country (Normalised):**  This column consistently shows "United Arab Emirates" for all entries.
* **DATE:** This column contains dates in various formats (some are YYYY-MM-DD, others are MM-DD-YYYY).
* **Product:** This column shows "Kappa" for all entries.
* **Sales:** This column contains numerical values representing sales figures, all in the format XX.XX (with two decimal places).
* **Cost:** This column contains numerical values representing costs, also all in the format XX.XX (with two decimal places).

The table appears to record sales and costs of a product called "Kappa" in the United Arab Emirates over a period of time spanning from 2022 to 2023.  The data is likely extracted from a larger database or accounting system.  The downward-pointing arrows in the header row suggest the ability to sort the data by column.

**Image Description:** The image contains a table showing sales data for a product called "Kappa" in the United Arab Emirates.  The table has six rows, each representing a different sales transaction. The columns are:

* **Country (Normalised):** This column indicates the country where the sales occurred, consistently listed as "United Arab Emirates" for all entries.

* **DATE:** This column shows the date of each sales transaction in YYYY-MM-DD format. The dates span from 2022-01-15 to 2023-02-07.

* **Product:**  This column specifies the product sold, consistently listed as "Kappa" for all entries.

* **Sales:** This column shows the sales amount (presumably in a local currency) for each transaction.  The values vary significantly.

* **Cost:** This column shows the cost associated with each sales transaction. The cost values also vary.

The table is formatted in a spreadsheet-like style with a light blue background and darker blue header row.  There are filter icons (represented as downward-pointing arrows) in the header cells of the "DATE", "Product" and "Sales" columns.  This suggests the data may come from a spreadsheet program that allows sorting and filtering.

**Image Description:** The image shows a portion of a table, likely from a spreadsheet or database application.  The table has three columns with headers:  "city," "product," and "sales."

The data displayed shows sales information, specifically:

* **City:**  All entries in the "city" column show "London."
* **Product:** All entries in the "product" column show "Computer."
* **Sales:** The "sales" column contains various numerical values representing sales figures (406, 916, 821, 457, 922, 610, 111, 109, 866, 975). These numbers are likely representing units sold or monetary values.

The dropdown arrows next to the column headers suggest that the table allows filtering or sorting by each column.  The data shown is consistent, only showing sales of computers in London.  The numbers in the sales column are all different, indicating a range of sales figures across different time periods or transactions.

**Image Description:** The image shows a Google AI Studio webpage where a user is attempting to create an API key to interact with the Gemini API.

The left sidebar displays various options within the AI Studio, including "Prompt," "Realtime," "Apps," "Model," "Chat history," "Gallery," "Documentation," and "Forum".

The main content area displays the title "API keys" and a subtitle explaining that it allows for quick testing of the Gemini API.  Below this is an "API quickstart guide" section showing a `curl` command example to send a request to the Gemini API.  The request is designed to ask the Gemini API: "Explain how AI works". This command includes headers for the content type and the HTTP POST method, and a JSON payload containing the text prompt.  There's also a button to download this code snippet and a clear warning to "Use code with caution".

Below the code example is a button labeled "Create API key."

Further down, a table is meant to list existing API keys, but displays an error message instead. The error message indicates that "Resource Manager project creation is disabled,"  and provides error codes and timestamps. It advises users to contact their administrator to resolve the issue.  The table headers are "Project number," "Project name," "API key," and "Created."

The URL bar at the top shows the user is on a page related to API key management within Google AI Studio.  The overall appearance and formatting are consistent with Google's design language.

@Saransh_Saini

Q5 fixed, thanks for fixing the issue.


Now we are struggling with Q8.

MY q8 is : Write a DuckDB SQL query to find all posts IDs after 2025-01-09T12:36:14.085Z with at least 1 comment with 4 useful stars, sorted. The result should be a table with a single column called 
post_id
 , and the relevant post IDs should be sorted in ascending order.

when i use below query, i get some some result, a table of post_id but error : 
Error
: At root: Array length mismatch


Reason
:  below query checking only 1st comment (
$[0]
 refers to the first comment in the array) we have to check all comments not 1st.

But when i change the query to check any one comment its giving different types of error.


WITH filtered_posts AS (
  SELECT post_id
  FROM social_media
  WHERE timestamp >= '2025-01-09T09:48:01.303Z'
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM social_media AS sm
      WHERE json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') IS NOT NULL
        AND CAST(json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') AS INTEGER) > 4
    )
)
SELECT post_id
FROM filtered_posts
ORDER BY post_id ASC;



Kindly check if any issue with Q8.

May be my query is wrong or may be not.


Thankyou

@lakshaygarg654


Your query construction is unnecessarily complicated and therefore will be difficult to debug.


Query construction is best done by thinking what you want at the end.

In this case its an ordered 
post_id


So thats where you begin:


SELECT post_id
FROM (
...
)
ORDER BY post_id



Doing this, produces the actual result without giving the logic yet.


Then at each stage you add the next stage of complexity.

You will still need the 
post_id
 for the 
outermost layer
 so you have to continue extracting it from the 
inner layers
 of the nested query.


...
...
FROM (
   SELECT post_id, ( ... ) as max_stars
   FROM social_media
   WHERE time_stamp >= (whatever the parameter you have been given)
      AND max_stars >= (whatever the parameter for min stars you have been given)
)
...
...



Then the final layer of the nest


...
...
(

) as max_stars

You are not expecting me to solve the whole question right? (Hint: the inner most extraction involves JSON or “structure” extraction, which is a powerful capability)


But I hope you understand the logic of SQL which is a very elegant set theory language which is why it has lasted for over 4 decades.


Think clearly at each stage what do you need. Start with the answer and work backwards, extracting at each stage the logical items you require for the outer layer to be functional.


Kind regards

Its been done. You will get a more detailed error now. And we have relaxed the number of errors allowed (it actually did have a tolerance limit but it was fairly tight)

## Post #49 by daksh76 (Post ID: 597255)
sir even after applying this logic im getting error at root: array length mismatch

---

## Post #50 by carlton (Post ID: 597259)
@daksh76
 thats because your innermost logic layer must not return a long list of results.


If you think about it logically each row cannot have a column field where one of the columns is a whole row of results right?


Thats why you are getting the error.


Check your innermost layer is returning a single value or a row of results.


Kind regards

Thank you for your response 
@carlton
. You are absolutely right—my query was unnecessarily complex. Initially, I attempted a simpler approach, using various JSON extraction functions. However, I encountered multiple errors, including:




json_extract
: 
“Table Function with name ‘json_extract’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”


json_each
: 
“Table Function with name ‘json_each’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”


json_extract_path_text
: 
“Table Function with name ‘json_extract_path_text’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”




Since the simple approach did not work, I attempted a more complex query to achieve the desired result. However, that too did not yield the expected output. To gain better insight, I extracted ten values into a table using the console and then reconstructed the query accordingly. Unfortunately, I am still facing issues related to functions not being recognized in the catalog.

I would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue. I do not need the exact answer; I just want to know if there is any issue with the portal for 
Q8
.


Thankyou

**Image Description:** The image is a simple graphic consisting of two bright yellow shapes against a completely black background. 


The main feature is a large, somewhat blurry, bright yellow circle.  To its right, and significantly smaller, is a smaller, oblong, bright yellow shape that resembles a short, thick dash or rectangle.  There is no text or other details present.  The shapes appear to be glowing or have a soft edge.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/9/f/9feb8d9eda659046c7b46bc317f582e1cf29fb2b_2_690x362.jpeg)

**Image Description:** The image is a simple, minimalist design on a black background. 


The only element is a stylized, bright yellow icon. The icon consists of a larger yellow circle, slightly off-center, and a smaller, rectangular yellow shape extending to the right from the circle's edge. This shape is thinner and shorter than the circle's diameter.


The overall impression is simple and potentially symbolic or representational, but without further context, its meaning is unclear.  It could be a logo, a symbol, or a simple graphic element. There is no text or other markings present.

In this question, I am asked to find the total margin for transactions before 
Tue, Jun 14, 2022, 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)
 for 
Theta
 sold in 
the US
 (which may be spelled in different ways).


However, when I filter in Excel for 
US
 and 
Theta
, there are no entries for 
Sales
 and 
Cost
. But 
0
 as the answer is not accepted—it says the answer is incorrect.


(I cross-checked this using GPT.)

**Image Description:** This image presents a data cleaning and analysis task for RetailWise Inc., a retail analytics firm.  The company has received an Excel sheet with messy sales data and needs to calculate the total margin for specific transactions.

**Key Information:**

* **The Task:** Clean the Excel data and compute the total margin for transactions meeting certain criteria.
* **Data Cleaning Challenges:** The data contains inconsistencies in:
    * **Customer Name:** Leading/trailing spaces.
    * **Country:** Inconsistent representations (e.g., "USA", "US", "U.S.A").
    * **Date:** Mixed formats ("MM-DD-YYYY", "YYYY/MM/DD").
    * **Product:** Product names followed by irrelevant codes (needs extraction).
    * **Sales and Cost:** Extra spaces, currency symbols ("USD"), and missing cost values (to be treated as 50% of sales).
    * **TransactionID:** Inconsistent spacing.
* **Filtering Criteria:**
    * **Time:** Transactions up to and including "Tue Jun 14 2022 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)".
    * **Product:** Product name "Theta" (excluding the code after the slash).
    * **Country:** "US" (after standardizing inconsistent spellings).
* **Margin Calculation:**  Total Margin = (Total Sales - Total Cost) / Total Sales.
* **Data File:** The Excel file to be cleaned is named `clean-up-excel-sales-data.xlsx`.
* **Question:** The final question asks for the total margin (as a percentage or decimal) for transactions meeting the above criteria.  An initial incorrect answer of `0.0` is shown, prompting the user to try again.

In short, the image details a data analysis problem requiring data cleaning and filtering before a margin calculation can be performed. The provided context and the file name give enough information to solve the problem.

**Image Description:** The image is a complex collage composed of numerous smaller images and text blocks arranged in a grid-like pattern. The overall style is steampunk-inspired, featuring intricate mechanical gears, circuit diagrams, and sepia-toned color palettes.  The various sections appear to be biographical profiles or data entries of different individuals.

Here's a breakdown of the observable content:

* **Individual Portraits:** Several portraits of men, some wearing graduation caps, are prominently featured.  One portrait is identified with the text "USKY UMAR" above it.  The individual portraits show different ethnicities and ages.  Some profiles are more detailed, seemingly including titles, occupations, or other descriptive elements.

* **Steampunk Elements:**  Gears, cogs, and circuit-like patterns are liberally scattered throughout the image, creating a visually busy but cohesive aesthetic. These elements are interwoven with the portraits and textual information.

* **Textual Information:**  There is a mix of text that is legible and text that is too small to decipher clearly. Legible sections include phrases such as: "BACKGROUND PROFILE EDITING," "A SUITCASE," "HAGGE," "AIDGM EXTERIOR," "ENGTEBROGRAND," "Odontes", and "VIRGY CHAN" (partially obscured).  This suggest that the collage depicts biographies or technical profiles, and possibly relates to a game, a book, or some other kind of narrative project.  Much of the text seems to be technical or descriptive jargon.

* **Structural Elements:** The overall structure is a patchwork of square or rectangular blocks, almost like a mosaic. This fractured style gives the impression of a complex system or interconnected network.

In summary, the image is a visually rich representation of biographical or technical information presented in a stylized, steampunk-inspired manner. The fragmented nature and complex design suggests a narrative or system involving multiple characters and components. The stylistic choices strongly imply a science fiction, fantasy, or historical-fiction themed context.

For Q8, I wrote the following query,


SELECT smo.post_id
FROM social_media as smo
WHERE smo.timestamp >= '2024-11-15T06:02:28.656Z'
AND EXISTS (
   SELECT 1
   FROM LATERAL (
       SELECT UNNEST(json_extract(comments, '$[*]'))
       FROM social_media as sm
       WHERE sm.post_id = smo.post_id
       ) AS c(value)
    WHERE json_extract(c.value, '$.stars.useful')::DOUBLE = 4)
order by smo.post_id;



What it does is for each post_id, checks the timestamp and then checks the presence of a json object in comments that has 4 stars useful rating for this post_id. Finally returns all the post_id’s in ascending order.


But it’s giving me an 
Array length mismatch
 error. I’m stuck here. Any hints would be helpful.

P.S. I also noticed that the timestamp given in the question keeps changing with each page reload. But the output from the query stays the same.

**Image Description:** The image shows a computer screen displaying a graded assignment within a web browser. 


The main content is a data analysis task.  The instructions explain a data set containing log entries of web requests, each entry having fields like:

* **Request:**  Method (e.g., GET), URL, and Protocol (e.g., HTTP/1.1).  The example "GET /blog/ HTTP/1.1" shows the three components separated by spaces.
* **Status:** HTTP status code (successful requests are between 200 and 300).
* **Size:** Response size in bytes.
* **Referer:** Referring URL.
* **User agent:** Browser used.
* **Vhost:** Virtual host.
* **Server:** Server's IP address.


The data is space-separated and uses double quotes for quoting, escaping internal double quotes with a backslash.  This affects 41 rows of the data. The data's timezone is GMT-0500.


The question asks for the number of successful GET requests (status code 200-299) specifically for URLs under `/malayalammp3/` between 10:00 and 17:00 on Saturdays.

A user has attempted the answer "2316", which the system marked as incorrect.  A "Check" button is available to resubmit an answer.


The top of the screen shows the browser's address bar with a URL related to an exam ("exam.sanandworkers.dev/...") and other browser tabs.  A score of "0/10" indicates the user's progress on the assignment. The bottom of the screen shows a system tray and clock.

QUESTION 9


I was supposed to transcribe the audio of the provided video for a certain time period. After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.


Here was my transcription - " Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.


In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”


The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.


Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.


From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.


Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation "

**Image Description:** Here's a description of the image's content:

The image shows a web page interface, likely for an online quiz or assessment.  The top section displays the title "TDS 2025 Jan GAS - Data н" (the "н" may be a typo or part of a longer, cut-off word).  Below this, a section titled "Instructions" provides seven numbered guidelines:

1.  Use provided reading material as needed.
2.  Regularly check answers to see right/wrong responses.
3.  Regularly save progress; the last save is the final submission.
4.  Reloading is acceptable; answers are browser-saved, not server-saved.
5.  Address browser loading issues by disabling security restrictions or trying a different browser.
6.  Any resources are allowed (internet, ChatGPT, etc.).
7.  The quiz is "hackable"—the code can be manipulated to find answers.

There are buttons labeled "Check all" and "Save".  A "Score: 0" indicates the user's current score.  The top also shows that the assessment ended at 11:59 pm IST on February 21st, 2025.

Further down, a button prompts users with questions to "Join the discussion on Discourse."  The user is logged in as "23f1002709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" and has a "Logout" button.

Finally, a "Recent saves" section shows three recent save points, each with the date and time, and a score of 10. Each save point has a "Reload" button next to it.
