I got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‘dockerfile’. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm.


Shall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?

The name of the Dockerfile should be “Dockerfile” indeed, more over check other sections of your submission like




Is the GitHub repo public?


Does it have an MIT license?


Does it have a DockerFile?


Is the Docker image accessible?

Oh ok made the changes in Github. I hope submitting again is not required since the links and names are same.

Sir, i got this mail. I have checked that the repo is public and already has a Dockerfile.

I have renamed the ‘LICENSE’ file as ‘MIT LICENSE’.

**Image Description:** The image presents text against a white background. The text is divided into two paragraphs.

The first paragraph is a list of criteria. It starts with "No such repo;", then lists "No 'MIT' in LICENSE;" and finally, "No Dockerfile". These appear to be checks for a software project submission.

The second paragraph is an instruction that begins with "Please ensure that your submission..." followed by a statement that the submission must pass the checklist provided in order to be considered for scoring.

Sir, please consider it we have spent a lot of time, in my case just the d in Dockerfile was small that too on remote repository. On my local repository it was Dockerfile only I even have a published docker image as verified by you autated script only. The name of the file on remote repository did not change even after commit it through my local repo, once I read the mail in morning it was only then I realised it wasn’t changed on GitHub repo.


Sir I understand the deadline has passed and I am not asking for a resubmission, I am just asking to consider the already submitted work, just that. It would be really helpful. I just have one commit on my repo that too “Rename dockerfile to Dokerfile” . Sir please attest consider what we have already submitted. I have made no changes as you can verify it too.


Sir it is a humble request to please consider it.


Warm Regards,

Satvik Sawhney

**Image Description:** Here is a detailed description of the image:

**Overview:**

The image appears to be a file listing or a version control interface, likely from a code repository like GitHub or GitLab. The format suggests a directory/file structure with associated metadata such as descriptions and timestamps. The UI uses a dark theme.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

*   **File/Directory List:**
    *   The left-hand side contains the file and directory structure. Folders are represented by folder icons, and files are shown with document icons. The following items are listed:
        *   `Business` (Folder)
        *   `Operations` (Folder)
        *   `app` (Folder)
        *   `Dockerfile` (File)
        *   `LICENSE` (File)
        *   `README.md` (File)
*   **Descriptions:**
    *   The middle column provides descriptions for each entry. Some entries are related to the changes or content.
        *   `Business`:  "Reconfigured taskB8 taskB9 taskB10"
        *   `Operations`: "Reconfigured taskA8 taskA9 taskA10"
        *   `app`: "Updated Dockerfile and requirements.txt"
        *   `Dockerfile`: "Rename dockerfile to Dockerfile"
        *   `LICENSE`: "MIT License"
        *   `README.md`: "Project Structure"
*   **Timestamps:**
    *   The right-hand column indicates when the files or directories were last modified or when changes were made.
        *   "2 days ago" (appears multiple times)
        *   "yesterday"
        *   "3 days ago" (appears multiple times)
*   **Additional Information (right panel icons):**
    *   There are several icons in the right-hand panel, suggesting additional controls or options for navigating or managing the repository. These include icons for different actions, such as:
        *   an icon of a scale (like a balance or justice scale)
        *   an icon of a waveform
        *   an icon of a star
        *   an icon of an eye
        *   an icon of a chain link
        *   a button saying "Re"

**Overall Impression:**

The image suggests a project with a well-defined structure that includes folders for different categories (Business, Operations, app) and configuration files (Dockerfile, LICENSE, README). The presence of a Dockerfile indicates this project likely uses Docker for containerization. The change descriptions and timestamps imply ongoing development with recent commits.
