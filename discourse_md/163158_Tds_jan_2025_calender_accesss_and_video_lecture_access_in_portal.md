The course introduction has very important information. Many students who faced problems in Tools for Data Science in previous terms usually never read the intro. Please be diligent to read 
everything carefully.


Don’t gloss over these bits (they are expandable if you click on them) for eg…

**Image Description:** The image contains a description of a course, likely from a university or online learning platform.  Here's a breakdown:

**Header/Overview:**

*   "This course exposes you to real-life tools" is the top line, suggesting the course's focus.
*   "This course is quite hard" is highlighted with a drop-down arrow, indicating this might be a summary or specific message about the course difficulty.

**Student Feedback:**

*   A bulleted list presents student feedback on the course.
    *   "It used to be an easy course until 2024. ###" (suggests a recent change making the course more difficult)
    *   "Now it's hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. ###" (recommends when to take the course)
    *   "Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. ###" (emphasizes time commitment)
    *   "LLMs grade you - unpredictably. # #" (suggests use of LLMs in grading and potential inconsistency)
    *   "The ROE is hard. #" (ROE, which could refer to a Report of Examination or another abbreviation, is noted as being difficult)

**Prerequisites/Recommendations:**

*   "You need a good understanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts." (specifies necessary skills)
*   "Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you're ready for this course. Please drop this course in a later term if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now." (includes an assessment to determine course readiness and advice if struggling)

**Additional Information:**

*   "Programming skills are a pre-requisite" (a key requirement for the course)
*   "We encourage learning by sharing" (states the course's policy)

The overall impression is that this is a technically demanding course that has become more challenging recently. It's crucial to assess your readiness through the suggested assignment and be prepared to dedicate extra time if you enroll.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of an online learning platform or course management system. It has a left sidebar with a navigation menu and a main content area on the right.

**Left Sidebar (Navigation):**

*   A dark blue sidebar houses a menu.
*   The menu lists various sections of the course:
    *   Course Introduction
    *   Module 1: Development Tools
    *   Graded Assignment 1 (appears selected/active)
    *   Module 2: Deployment Tools

*   **Title:** "Graded Assignment 1"
*   **Important Instructions & Information:**
    *   "Due date for this assignment: 2025-01-26, 23:59 IST."
    *   "You may submit any number of times before the due date. The final submission will be considered for grading."
    *   A section titled "If you have any difficulty accessing the Graded Assignment, please check the following causes:" is followed by a numbered list of potential troubleshooting steps:
        1.  Ad blockers need to be disabled/removed.
        2.  The site requires cookies for authentication. So any cookie blocking/tracker blocking extensions or software may prevent access.
        3.  Javascript is required for the site to work correctly.

        5.  Disable any browser extensions that may be interfere with the site from working correctly.
        6.  Overly aggressive anti-virus software may also cause similar access problems.

*   **Graded Assignment Question:**
    *   "1) I have seen the Graded Assignment 1 available at this link and have attempted it."
        *   **Answer Options:** "Yes" and "No" (radio buttons).
*   **Button:** "Submit Answers"

**Additional Details:**

*   The interface is clean and modern, likely designed for a user-friendly experience.

**In summary,** the image displays a graded assignment within an online course, with instructions, troubleshooting advice, and a question requiring the user to confirm they have seen the assignment and attempted it. It emphasizes the need to follow technical guidelines (disabling blockers, enabling cookies, etc.) and use a specific student ID to avoid issues with grading.
