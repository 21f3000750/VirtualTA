sir 
@Jivraj
 after editing line 127 in datagen.py i got those  required data files. is it allowed ? also i had to run datagen.py MANUALLY(is this process also should be automatic)?

### Image Insight:
![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/2/0/20410aa56e88be04883b6f3feca5010089afe276_2_690x67.png)

**Image Description:** The image is a code snippet or instructions related to a data science project. Let's break it down:

*   **Header**: It begins with "→ A1. Install uv (if required) and run". This suggests it's the first step in a sequence of actions, labeled A1. It indicates that installing the 'uv' package might be a prerequisite.
*   **Command to run**: The next lines show a command.
    *   It points to a Python script hosted online: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/datagen.py`.
    *   The instructions say to run the script with the argument `${user.email}`. This indicates that the script needs an email address as input.
*   **Note**: The instructions include a note within parentheses that says, "(NOTE: This will generate data files required for the next tasks.)". This highlights that the script's main purpose is to create data files for subsequent operations.

In summary, the image presents an instruction to download and run a Python script (`datagen.py`) that will take an email address as an argument to generate data. This data will then be used in later steps.

Hi Guddu ,


I didn’t make any changes to file and it worked for me. Can you mention what is need of making changes ?


command that I used :


uv run datagen.py 22f3002542@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --root ./data


here --root option defines the folder where you want to store generated data. by default it would try to create a folder in root directory of operating system.


Kind regards

Hi Aishik,


Pls add context to your query, without that we won’t be able to understand, where exactly you are facing problem.








 23f2005325:




openai.AuthenticationError: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}







Possible reasons for this issue:




Not using anand sir’s proxy url for sending requests.


Token not being correct.

## Post #13 by 23f2005325 (Post ID: 585171)
While implementing task A5, I am confused about what recent actually means in the phrase “recent log file”, mentioned under task A5, in the problem statement. This confusion arises because there are no dates corresponding to the log files. Should I consider log-0 as the most recent one? or the log-<largest_number> file? Please clarify.

do we have to do these tasks in the linux? As in some of the GA1, the linux answers only accepted. Please tell me that, do we can do it in the desktop or we have to use linux?

## Post #17 by Saransh_Saini (Post ID: 586429)
The bash commands are usually run in a linux machine, but you can easily run those commands in VSCode without installing any virtual machines. Download the WSL extension in VSCode and you will get a WSL terminal to work with.


For more information watch this video

Project 1 deliverables are all that matter. How you accomplish them is not very relevant. The keys to a successful Project 1 are:

Deliverables,

and 
an example
 of the Evaluation has been provided.

If your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered.


Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am
1764×1764 374 KB


Please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom.


So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.


Kind regards

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed breakdown of the image's content:

**Overall Structure:**

*   The image appears to be a set of instructions or guidelines for a project or assignment.
*   It's divided into two main sections, "Deliverables" and "Evaluation", each indicated by a heading and an arrow.
*   The "Deliverables" section, highlighted by a red box, lists a series of steps required to complete the project.
*   A "Note" section provides additional important information, clarifications, and constraints.

**Deliverables Section:**

*   This section outlines the tasks needed to complete the project. The numbered list describes steps, including:
    *   Creating a GitHub repository
    *   Adding an MIT license file
    *   Writing and testing code (with specific API calls: `POST /run?task=...` and `GET /read?path=...`)
    *   Committing and pushing code
    *   Creating a Dockerfile
    *   Publishing a Docker image to Docker Hub
    *   Ensuring the image runs correctly (with a `podman run` command example, setting an environment variable).
    *   Submitting a Google Form with the GitHub repository and Docker image URLs.

**Note Section:**

*   This section elaborates on important instructions and constraints:
    *   **Environment Variables:**  Emphasizes the use of the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable and the importance of not committing the token to the repository.
    *   **AI Proxy Token Usage:** Describes the cost ($1 limit) and who to ask for more, with an encouragement to avoid exceeding the limit.
    *   **Model Restriction:**  States the project should stick to GPT-4o-Mini.
    *   **Prompt Guidelines:** Indicates that prompts should be short and concise, and that each `/run` and `/read` call should take no more than 20 seconds.

**Evaluation Section:**

*   The image indicates a separate "Evaluation" section, although the image provided does not show its specific content.

**Key Objects/Features for Answering Questions:**

*   **Text:** The text provides detailed instructions on what needs to be done and the project's constraints. Key terms to pay attention to include: GitHub, Docker, API calls, environment variables, and the AI Proxy.
*   **Code Snippets:** Examples of the `podman run` command and calls to an API are provided, demonstrating the execution requirements.
*   **Links/References:**  The inclusion of Google Form (implied), GitHub URLs, and Docker Hub indicate necessary tools and services.
*   **Style:** The bullet point format, the use of bolding, and the colored boxes suggest that this is a structured instruction document.

**Image Description:** Here's a breakdown of the image's content:

**Left Side (Sidebar):**

*   There's a sidebar with a heading that says "Project 1".
*   Below that, it says "Project 1" with an icon that appears to be a clock symbol.
*   Under the text "Project 1" it states "Assignment".

**Right Side (Main Content):**

*   The text starts with "1) I have seen Project 1 available at this link and have attempted it." The word "link" appears to be hyperlinked, likely to a resource related to Project 1.
*   Below the question is a multiple-choice option: a radio button labeled "Yes."

**Overall:**

The image displays a survey or quiz element related to "Project 1." The user is asked if they have viewed and attempted a project available via a provided link. The only answer option provided is "Yes." This structure is common in assessments or feedback gathering in online learning environments.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/9/3/937562cc32dc76a582f6845678b048730622d388_2_690x229.png)

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Layout:**

*   The image appears to be a screenshot of a webpage.
*   The webpage is split into two main sections:
    *   **Left Side:** A navigation panel for "Tools in Data Science". This panel has a search bar and a nested menu structure.
    *   **Right Side:** The primary content area, displaying information about "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent."

**Left Side Navigation Panel:**

*   **Title:** "Tools in Data Science" is prominently displayed at the top.
*   **Search:** A search bar is present, labeled "Type to search."
*   **Navigation Menu:**
    *   The menu items are organized hierarchically using arrows:
        *   "Tools in Data Science" (expandable)
        *   "Development Tools" (expandable)
        *   "Deployment Tools" (expandable)
        *   "Large Language Models" (expandable)
        *   "Project 1" (expanded)
            *   "Background" (highlighted/selected, indicating the current content)
            *   "Create an API"
            *   "Phase A: Handle Operatio..."
            *   "Phase B: Handle Business..."
            *   "Deliverables"

**Right Side Content Area:**

*   **Title:** "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent" is the main heading.
*   **Project Details:**
    *   "This project is due on 15 Feb 2025 EOD IST. Results will be announced by 25 Feb 2025." This provides project deadlines.
    *   "For questions, use this Discourse thread." is a link for questions.
*   **Background:** This is a subheading, likely introducing the project's context.
    *   The text describes a scenario where the viewer has joined the operations team at "DataWorks Solutions," a company that processes large volumes of log files, reports, and code artifacts.
    *   The company wants to automate routine tasks and integrate them into a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.
    *   Due to the unpredictable nature of the incoming data, the team is going to use a Large Language Model (LLM) as an intermediate transformer.

**Overall:**

The image appears to be an educational resource or a project description. It is focusing on a "Large Language Model" (LLM) in the context of data science or software development. The navigation on the left lets the user explore more about the project, while the main content provides the background and context for the project.

Hi 
@Divya1
 ,


There won’t be any project1 page such as GA1s, there is a google form(which can be found in same page) which needs to be filled after you do project1.

## Post #25 by Jivraj (Post ID: 586910)
Hi 
@23f2005325
 ,


Extracting details from credit cards is sensitive, try using strong prompts or take code from LLM and execute it in script.

## Post #26 by 23f1002382 (Post ID: 587088)
Regarding Wednenday 9-10 pm live session, maybe the instructors could also discuss how to use docker as a virtual environment using maybe ollama(local llm as now there is deepseek opensource, i doubt we would need to use openai for testing, just for production(test submission)  would be enough) and also some agent(langchain, autogen, crewai) just a quick how-to on setting up and problems while setting up if possible


More resources on docker. Using docker as a virtual environment. Editing and executing code in Dockerfiles (like when you change code in src a web framework automatically reloads page(hot reload)), something along the lines of this .

Regarding Wednenday 9-10 pm live session, maybe the instructors could also discuss how to use docker as a virtual environmen






In Tuesday’s(21 January) session we had discussed docker towards ending of session.

What was discussed in that live session regarding docker:




Search for existing containers on repositories such as dockerhub.


Pull an existing docker image.


Run that image inside a container.


Enter to that container and modify something(such as installing python inside a ubuntu container, for customization or create some file)


Once done you can commit it.


And push customized container’s image to docker hub.




Regarding local models running for project1, it’s a good idea, we will see if it’s possible to discuss in session.

We had a session on 28th Jan introducing all the important aspects of Project.


If you do not do everything exactly as mentioned 
especially the pre - requisites
 mentioned in the Evaluation section you will get 0 in the project and 
there will be no appeal
 for failing to meet the pre - requisites of the evaluation criteria.


In order for us to evaluate the project you have to provide the deliverables mentioned above.

**Image Description:** The image is a slide titled "Deliverables," indicated by the text in the top left corner, alongside a red star in the top right. The slide outlines a set of instructions for a task, likely a coding project or assignment. The listed deliverables are:

*   Create a new public GitHub repository.
*   Add an MIT LICENSE file.
*   Write and test code with POST and GET calls.
*   Commit and push the code.
*   Create a Dockerfile to build an application.
*   Publish the Docker image to Docker Hub.
*   Ensure that the application runs via the podman run command, specifying environment variables and port mapping. This command automatically serves an API.
*   The last deliverable, highlighted with a red border, instructs the user to submit the URL of their GitHub repository and their Docker image name in a Google Form. Specific examples are given for each field (GitHub URL and Docker image name).

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/8/9/898ab28ebe773e40fb3ad9b98c71ce4c5d063c09_2_690x234.png)

**Image Description:** The image outlines the prerequisites for evaluating something, likely a software project hosted on GitHub. Here's a breakdown:

**Overall Structure:**

*   The text is formatted as a list of bullet points.
*   The title indicates that the document explains how something will be scored.

**Key Content:**

*   **Title:** "Here's how we will score the results."
*   **Section Heading:** "Pre-requisites:" These are conditions that MUST be met for the evaluation.
*   **Prerequisites (criteria for evaluation):**
    *   The GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible.
    *   The GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license (specifies licensing requirements)
    *   The GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile (used to create the Docker image).
    *   The Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via a `podman run` command.
    *   The Docker image utilizes the same Dockerfile as in your GitHub repository.
*   **`podman run` command:**
    *   `podman run`: The command used to run the Docker image.
    *   `$IMAGE_NAME`: A placeholder for the name of the Docker image.
    *   `-e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN`: Sets an environment variable.
    *   `-p 8000:8000`: Maps port 8000 on the host machine to port 8000 inside the Docker container. This facilitates network access to the application running within the container.

**Purpose:**

The image appears to be a set of guidelines or instructions for submitting or evaluating a project, likely involving Docker, on a platform like GitHub. The checklist-like structure suggests that the project's compliance with these conditions is crucial for its evaluation. The mention of "MIT license" and "Docker" suggests a software or research project.

For A6, /data/docs/ has subfolders with .md files from which we have to extract the heading level 1’s (#) right? Apparently there are few files with different content but the same name. Can someone confirm the same? If yes how to address these files

I had set up the environment and dependencies and everything was working fine. When i tried to recreate it from scratch in a new codespace it broke. I fixed almost everything except this error

Hi

Filepath is unique for every file, which needs to be inserted to json file.

---

## Post #39 by JoelJeffrey (Post ID: 588156)
Ok. So just to confirm, since there are files with the same name, the json file should map the filepath and not the filename to the title right?

**Image Description:** The image is a snippet of text detailing a task related to file processing. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Task Description:** The text outlines the steps to process Markdown (`.md`) files within a specific directory (`/data/docs/`).
*   **Actions:**
    *   Find all `.md` files in `/data/docs/`.
    *   For each file, extract the first header line (the first line starting with `#`). This is a common Markdown convention for headings.
    *   Create an index file named `/data/docs/index.json`.
    *   The index file will map each filename (without the full path) to its corresponding title.
*   **Example:** An example is provided showing the intended format of the JSON index file, showing how the filenames `"README.md"` and `"large-language-models.md"` would map to the titles `"Home"` and `"Large Language Models"`, respectively.
*   **Format:** The overall content is formatted in a bulleted list form.
*   **Context:** The text appears to be a description of a programming task or a set of instructions related to file management or data extraction. It might be a part of a larger document detailing a software development project or a data processing pipeline.

  what is the problem here??

please do a live session of complete project process with one or two tasks if possible

Hi Guddu,


We are planning several project sessions in order to show the workflow of creating a successful project.


Although you are returning a 200 ok, the get request file must match the expectation. In other words after running the first task for example, has the new format.md been formatted correctly and matches the expected output.


In this case you would write out the the 
expected
 variable in the 
evaluate.py
 and see if 
result
 variable matches the 
expected
. Then you can figure out what went wrong.


Kind regards

## Post #43 by 22f3001315 (Post ID: 588211)

But please try to take those sessions sooner

Because it’s taking too much time for me to do any problem(plus two more courses and one oppe you know) .so I just want to build the project before deadline.

## Post #46 by 23f1002382 (Post ID: 588510)
the model keeps wrong answer, it says uvicorn for uv and has no info on how to run uv even after explicitly giving instructions(basically an older model) , basic “ls” command is also wrong, among other things. You can check your logs with respect to my api key.

Do you think we could access a better model?


Maybe Download Deepseek 70b or even 671b and create an api while y’all run the model locally, in the long it would be cheaper for the course?

because the model doesn’t know basic commands after telling how to do it.

So if the model gives us wrong commands 2/3 times then how would we even solve the question.

I spent a week on this just saying

**Image Description:** Here is a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Composition:**

The image is a colorful, stylized infographic or illustration, likely meant to visually represent the topic of "Tools in Data Science." It is composed of several stylized graphic elements and a central text message. The overall feel is modern and professional. The background is black.

**Central Element:**

The primary focal point is a rectangular shape with rounded corners. Within the rectangle, a laptop with a screen displaying colorful, geometric shapes. Above the laptop, the text "TOOLS" is displayed in large, bold, orange letters. Below the word "TOOLS" is "IN" in a smaller font. Underneath this is the text "DATA SCIENCE," also in orange, suggesting that the laptop represents the tools used in data science.

**Surrounding Elements:**

*   **Top Section:** Above the central rectangle, there is a collection of various graphical icons and shapes. Some examples include circles with lines, a stylized tablet with a multi-colored flower, pencils, and a circuit diagram.
*   **Left and Right Sections:**  On both sides of the central rectangle are more graphical elements such as a line graph, a bar graph, a lock icon, a globe, and a stylized X and Y graph.
*   **Bottom Section:** Below the central rectangle is another set of stylized icons. A line graph, a network graph, a scissor, a bar graph, a pie chart, and an open eye.

**Color Scheme:**

The color palette primarily consists of orange, blue, teal, and various shades of gray, along with some highlights of red and yellow. This combination gives the image a modern and clean aesthetic.

**Overall Impression:**

The image is visually appealing and seems designed to be eye-catching. The various icons likely represent different tools, techniques, or concepts related to data science.  It suggests a broad scope, touching on data visualization, analysis, and possibly other related fields.

Hello, I recently started working on the project. I understood how to do all the phase A tasks on a high level but I’m struggling to start the implementation of the first task in phase A. I’m confused mainly about how the /data directory is supposed to be created, I don’t know how to generate the data and a little confused about the output formats. I would appreciate if I could get in contact with anyone who could guide me in the right direction.

## Post #53 by 21f3002390 (Post ID: 590128)
Hello everyone, 
@s.anand
 
@carlton

I had a few queries regarding the project;




I am preloading my docker image with uv and generating the /data files when the container is ran. For task A1, I am automating my server to remove the /data directory that’s already present and run datagen.py again. Is this fine?


For /read endpoint, is there a standard for parameters like “path=/data/format.md” or the parameter could be a plain english sentence like “path=show the data in format.md”?


Are we concerned about what’s shown on the console if I run a /run command as long as it gets the job done?


For tasks A1-10, are the file paths provided in the project doc standard or even they’re flexible? Ex. “Count the number of Wednesdays in file /data/format.md, and write just the number to /data/out.txt”

For Project-1 to complete, it requires:

"You MUST complete ALL these 3 steps to get a score. Failure to do so will result in getting 0 in the project. If you do not do ALL these 3 steps before the deadline, there will be no appeal available.

• Fill the form that is on the Project Page

But I did not get the form; where is it? While I checked inside the project pages also.

**Image Description:** The image is a screenshot of a document, likely a guide or tutorial, titled "Deliverables" within a larger context of "Tools in Data Science".

**Left Side Panel:**

*   A navigation menu with options related to "Tools in Data Science".
*   Subsections include "Development Tools", "Deployment Tools", "Large Language Models," and "Project 1," and so on.
*   "Phase B: Handle Business" is highlighted.

**Main Content (Deliverables):**

*   It provides a list of tasks or steps, likely related to a data science project:
    *   Create a public GitHub repository.
    *   Add a MIT LICENSE file.
    *   Write and test code, with instructions on how to call specific endpoints.
    *   Commit and push code.
    *   Create a Dockerfile.
    *   Publish a Docker image to Docker Hub.
    *   Ensure the image runs correctly using `podman run`.
    *   **A key instruction is to "Submit in this Google Form the URL of your GitHub repository"**. This line includes a link to a Google Form, which is likely for submitting the project or a part of it.  It also mentions submitting the Docker image name.
*   **Note section** with the following instructions:
    *   How to handle API keys using the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable, and how not to commit the token to the repository.
    *   Guidelines about using an AI proxy token.
    *   Specifies that the project should use GPT-4o-Mini as the LLM.
    *   Emphasizes the importance of keeping prompts short and concise, and that the API calls `/run` and `/read` should complete within 20 seconds.
*   Below the list, there's the title "Evaluation".

**Overall:**

The document is a guide for a data science project, outlining steps for project setup, implementation, and submission. It guides the user on how to create a project, build it, and deploy it. It also provides instructions related to API calls, and token security. The content seems geared toward practical coding and deployment of a data science project, potentially involving an API, Docker and an LLM.

@s.anand
 sir, I see that the project 1 timeline was changed from February 7 - 17, 2025 to January 17 - February 15 which undoubtedly is a good increase in duration. However, I have my GATE DA exam on Feb 15 and the exam center is unexpectedly far. So, I request you to consider pushing the deadline to at least Feb 16. If not, I’ll still do my best.

Hello! 
@carlton
 
@s.anand


Is the proxy server down right now?

I am getting this error when I am accessing the endpoint:


{‘id’: ‘chatcmpl-Axq55TzulOVjHYuXYIhkRQzCC3PNl’, ‘object’: ‘chat.completion’, ‘created’: 1738824915, ‘model’: ‘gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18’, ‘choices’: [{‘index’: 0, ‘message’: {‘role’: ‘assistant’, ‘content’: …, ‘costError’: ‘crypto.createHash is not a function’}


Or, do I have to install crypto module?

@21f3002390
 - AI Proxy is working and you 
did
 get the result. You can ignore any 
costError
. It won’t happen in the future anyway.


What’s happening?
 I was trying to generate a unique hash for each request, as a precursor to caching requests. But I made a mistake in the code. Specifically, 
crypto.createHash
 is not supported in CloudFlare. 
I fixed that
 by removing this. I’ll introduce caching later if required.

For the question 
#A8
 on recognizing the credit card number in the image, Open AI doesn’t seem to be recognizing the number correctly and as a result the evaluation is failing. What should be the solution?

**Image Description:** The image shows a series of commands and responses, likely from a terminal or code execution environment, that processes a credit card number from an image. Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Initial Task:**
    *   A task is described as:  "Running task: `/data/credit\_card.png` contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt`". This sets the context for the subsequent steps.

2.  **HTTP Request (POST):**
    *   A POST request is sent to `http://localhost:8000/run`.
    *   The request includes a task description encoded in the URL parameters. The task is related to extracting a credit card number and writing it to a text file.

3.  **HTTP Response (200 OK):**
    *   The server responds with a "200 OK" status code, indicating success.
    *   The response body is a JSON object that specifies the operation performed:
        *   `function": "extract_numbers_from_image"`:  The operation is to extract numbers from an image.
        *   `arguments`:  Contains:
            *   `input_file_path": "/data/credit\_card.png"`: Specifies the input image file.
            *   `output_file_path": "/data/credit-card.txt"`: Specifies the output text file to which the extracted number will be written.

4.  **HTTP Request (GET):**
    *   A GET request is sent to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/credit-card.txt`.
    *   This request attempts to read the contents of the `credit-card.txt` file, likely containing the extracted credit card number.

5.  **/data/credit-card.txt Content:**
    *   Two sections are shown below after the get request.
    *   The first section labeled "AEXPECTED" shows the expected credit card number: `4026399336539356`.
    *   The second section labeled "ARESULT" shows the actual result, which is `402639933635936`. This is slightly different than the expected value.

**In summary:** The image demonstrates a process of using a system to extract a credit card number from an image. The system uses a POST request to start this process and a GET request to read the output result.  The end result is shown, which is the extraction of a number from an image, with a mismatch between expected value and actual result.

A query regarding the task description in the query given to LLM for phase A.


For task A3, we have been asked to count wednesdays and the python file corresponding to A3 does count for wednesday alone. However the example says the LLM might be asked to count Sundays or other days. Should we be modifying task A3 code? Or was that just an example and only Wednesdays would need to be counted?

## Post #72 by carlton (Post ID: 591783)
Tasks in Phase A are defined but that does not mean it has to do one precise thing. If that was the case then there is no use for an LLM.


Your application should be able to take parse the input and be able to run commands that do similar things in parameterised fashion. It could be Wednesdays or Sundays or it might be in Arabic days or anything. So coding to precisely do something very specific is not the goal.


The program has to be intelligent to do a certain type or class of tasks.


We had a session introducing project. Week 3 session 1. But we will have a more hands on session on Tuesday.

**Image Description:** The image is a screenshot of a terminal window, likely showing an error message while running a Python script. Here's a breakdown:

**Content:**

*   **Error Message:** The most prominent part is the error message: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'datagen'". This indicates that the Python script "evaluatewEpC39.py" is trying to import a module named "datagen," but that module is not found in the Python environment.
*   **Traceback:** Above the error message, there's a "Traceback" which details where the error occurred. It pinpoints the file and line number (line 20 in "/tmp/evaluatewEpC39.py") where the import statement failed.
*   **Shell Prompt:** There's a Linux shell prompt "root@Vikash:/mnt/e/IITM/New/TDS/LLM\_Project#" visible at the beginning and end, suggesting the user is working within a Linux environment.
*   **Command:** The command used to run the Python script is also shown at the beginning and is: "uv run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanando/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/evaluate.py". It appears that a package manager/script runner "uv" is being used to execute the script.
*   **File Path:**  The screenshot shows the script's file path as "/tmp/evaluatewEpC39.py". It is being run from a different location.
*   **Environment variables:** The terminal prompt shows an environment variable OPENAI\_API\_KEY being set.

**In summary:** The image depicts a Python script that encountered a problem during execution. It failed to import a necessary module and is showing the traceback along with a Linux terminal prompt.

**Image Description:** The image displays a text string, likely a JSON object representing an API error message.  Here's a breakdown:

*   **Outer structure:** The entire string is enclosed within curly braces `{}`, indicating it's a JSON object.
*   **Error key:** It has a key-value pair `{'error':` with the value being the string `'API Error: 429,` followed by another JSON object.
*   **Error Code:** The API error code is 429.
*   **Nested object:** A nested object `{\n "message":` indicates the details of the error.
*   **Message Content:** The "message" key has a string value: `"On 2025-02 you used $2.002295600000011, exceeding $2"\n}`. This part specifies the error details: on February 2025, the user spent an amount of $2.002295600000011, which exceeds a limit of $2.

In summary, the image shows an API response indicating a rate limit or spending limit has been exceeded.

 Will there be evaluation script for tasks in group B also?


Some questions about ‘B’ group tasks:


Q1: For the following tasks (B5, B7, B9, and B10) tasks, how will input files be provided? Will it be URL or will 
datagen.py
 also generate files for these?


Q2: For the above tasks as well as for B6 ( Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website), how should output be returned?


Q3: In task B8, for transcribing audio file, which Python package is recommended or do we need to use OpenAI API?


B5. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database

B7. Compress or resize an image

B8. Transcribe audio from an MP3 file

B9. Convert Markdown to HTML

B10. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data

its expecting to  match every single detail in that even " and ’ .

in that case changing evaluate.py will result in zero or less marks.

llm will only handle  -calling function based on query and parameter   . What is it going to do about the logic of functions.


If i still focus on passing evaluate.py will it be any good sir

**Image Description:** The image displays a text string representing an API error. The text is formatted in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). 

Here's a breakdown:

*   **`{'error': 'API Error: 429, {`**: This indicates an error occurred, and the error code is 429. Error 429 typically signifies "Too Many Requests," meaning the user has exceeded the allowed rate limit for API calls.
*   **`\n "message": "On 2025-02 you used $2.002295600000011, exceeding $2"\n}`**: This is the detailed message providing context.
    *   `\n`: represents a newline character, indicating a line break.
    *   `"message":`: Describes the specific error information.
    *   `"On 2025-02 you used $2.002295600000011, exceeding $2"`:  This gives further information. Specifically the user used the specified amount ($2.002295600000011) on the date 2025-02 and has therefore exceeded a limit of $2.00.
*   **`}'`**:  The closing characters for the JSON structure.

In summary, the image shows an API error response that indicates a user has surpassed a spending limit.

**Image Description:** The image displays a section related to code and details, likely a response from an API or system. Here's a detailed breakdown:

*   **Header:** At the top, there are two columns labeled "Code" and "Details."
*   **Code 200:** Under the "Code" column, the number "200" is listed, which usually signifies a successful HTTP response.
*   **Response body:** Under the "Details" column, the text "Response body" is presented, indicating that the following content is the body of the response.
*   **JSON Response:** Following "Response body", there is a JSON formatted response within a dark grey box. The JSON has the following structure:
    *   `{`
        *   `"error": "Could not understand the task"`
    *   `}`

The "error" key indicates an issue, and the description, "Could not understand the task", suggests that the system was unable to process a given request.

## Post #103 by carlton (Post ID: 593709)
Hi Andrew,


You have done a great job with the Phase A tasks. Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy.


I just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application.


In other words getting 10/10 in 
evaluate.py
 does NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10  or 1/10 in the real evaluation.


So do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of 
evaluate.py
. It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general 
idea
 of the task.


That said, 
evaluate.py
 is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application).  Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty).


Hope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.)


A word of caution:
 
(i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation)
 Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task (
possibly your first task
) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.

Respected 
@s.anand
 
@carlton
 and 
@Jivraj
 ,


Is anyone actively monitoring the Discourse page? I have been raising this issue for the past few days, but there has been no response. Does this mean the TAs are not addressing students’ concerns?


I am encountering the following error while running my project with these LLM endpoints:




https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions


https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings



This issue is blocking my progress, and I urgently need assistance to resolve it. Kindly provide guidance or suggest a solution at the earliest.




Looking forward to your response.


Thanks,

Telvin Varghese

**Image Description:** The image displays a text string that appears to be an error message related to an API request. Here's a detailed breakdown:

**Overall Structure:**

*   The text is enclosed within curly braces {}, suggesting it's likely a JSON object or a similar data structure.
*   The text is displayed on a dark background, typical of a terminal or code editor environment.

**Key Elements:**

*   `'error': 'API Error: 429,`:  This indicates an error has occurred during an API call. The "429" is an HTTP status code, usually indicating "Too Many Requests" or rate limiting.
*   `{\n "message":`: The next part starts with "message" with the \n means that it is on another line or starts the next part of the data.
*   `"On 2025-02 you used $2.002295600000011, exceeding $2"\n}'`: This portion provides the specific error details, which is the message. It's a description of the reason for the error:
    *   It references a date, "2025-02", suggesting the error happened on that date.
    *   It mentions usage of "$2.002295600000011", which is a dollar amount.
    *   It states "exceeding $2", indicating that the user exceeded some sort of limit (possibly a spending limit, a quota, or a usage allowance).

**In summary:** The image shows an API error message. The error code 429 suggests rate limiting. The message explains that the user has exceeded a spending limit.

Hi,

I am not able to understand how to do the Project 1. The date is also very near.


The problem I am facing is, When I did the Modules the page was different, but now in the Project 1 I am not getting any section to submit the project.


Please let me know where are the questions and how tot submit that.

The deadline is near.

o do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of 
evaluate.py
. It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general 
idea
 of the task.






This where I need help, i tried doing with agentic framework but i failed with the model in llm proxy, which was highly suspect because, that model should have known what the uv framework but it seemed to me to be outdated. Hence executing code Interpreter tools failed as the model gave outdated code. I have raised this issue before


Hence i moved to function calling, using local llms as cost-effective solution and it was quite robust.


I just need to understand how the function should be general, maybe 2-3 tasks you could provide the general description along with all the ways one would query the agent llm(ie our project). This general function is what i need help with. Please kindly do the needful.

keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.






Any tentative size cutoff for the docker image?

## Post #109 by carlton (Post ID: 593802)
Hi Telvin


You have run out of tokens. Thats what the message is saying. You ran out 3 days ago. It was clearly mentioned that the limit is $1. You have exceeded $2.


Screenshot 2025-02-11 at 3.36.50 pm
2078×1276 305 KB


In our current internal build of project 1, we have yet to exceed $0.50


As to whether it can be renewed is something we have still not yet decided, because the question you have raised equally would apply to everyone. Raising it for you means raising it for everyone. $1 for everyone equals raising it by $1600+ 
(i.e Rs 1.39 Lakhs)
 for us!


The budget question then involves more than one person. It also involves the BS Team Operations and not just the TDS team and therefore instead of responding with a response that is not useful, we typically try to solve the problem first and then respond.


In short we are working on it. But as we have mentioned repeatedly in our sessions, use APIs efficiently, thats part of the skill. As soon as we have a resolution we will inform everyone via an announcement and an email.


Kind regards

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Layout:**

*   The image appears to be a screenshot of a webpage within a web browser. The browser's address bar is visible at the top.
*   The page is divided into two main sections: a sidebar on the left and the main content area on the right.

**Left Sidebar (Navigation):**

*   It contains a navigation menu labeled "Tools in Data Science."
*   There's a search bar at the top of the sidebar.
*   The menu items are organized hierarchically, with sub-items nested under main categories like "Tools in Data Science," "Development Tools," "Deployment Tools," and "Large Language Models."
*   The "Large Language Models" item is highlighted, suggesting the user is currently viewing that section.

**Main Content Area (Right Side):**

*   **Title:** The main heading is "Large Language Models."
*   **Introduction:**  The text begins with a brief introduction to LLMs, stating they are a new area and that the module covers their practical usage.
*   **Cost & Usage Limitations:** There's a section that addresses that LLMs incur a cost.
    *   It mentions the availability of API keys for those with an `iitm.ac.in` email address.
    *   It highlights that usage is limited to $1 per calendar month for the course.
*   **AI Proxy Instructions:**
    *   The page suggests using an "AI Proxy" instead of OpenAI directly.
    *   It provides specific instructions for replacing API endpoints and keys to use the proxy.

**Other Features:**

*   **Page navigation:**  There are "Previous" and "Next" links at the bottom of the main content, allowing the user to navigate through the content.
*   **Address Bar:** Shows the URL `tds.s-anand.net/#/large-language-models`, indicating the current location.

**Overall Impression:**

The webpage seems to be part of an educational resource or tutorial on large language models, likely associated with a course or project in data science. It provides practical information, including cost considerations, usage limitations, and guidance on utilizing an AI proxy to access LLM resources.

Every request you send, gives you a response back with exactly how much that request cost. So you can track your usage.

---

## Post #112 by 22f2001640 (Post ID: 593816)
I’m aware of that. I’ve mostly noticed a cost of $0.0003 per request, so I haven’t been tracking my total monthly expenses. Moving forward, I’ll keep a record of the cost for each request. Also, do strong prompts impact the overall cost?

**Image Description:** The image shows a terminal output displaying an error traceback from a Python script. Let's break down the content:

**1. Command Line:**
*   `abhro014@Abhro:/mnt/d/My_folder/IITM online degree/Diploma/TDS/Project1$`: This is the command-line prompt. It indicates the user is "abhro014" on a system named "Abhro" and the current working directory is within a project-related folder under a user's home directory. The "uv run" command is being used to execute a script.
*   `uv run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand...`: The user is running a script from a GitHub URL which is then followed by the script name.
*   `23f1002104@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`: Likely an email address or part of a network address.

**2. Error Message and Traceback:**
*   `Reading inline script metadata from remote URL`: This suggests the script is being retrieved from the provided URL and its metadata (likely comments, variable assignments, or other script information) is being read.
*   `Traceback (most recent call last):`: This indicates a Python error traceback, showing the sequence of function calls that led to the error.
*   `File "/tmp/datagen2eQ208.py", line 284, in <module>`: This pinpoints the location of the error. The error is in the file `/tmp/datagen2eQ208.py` on line 284, within the main part of the script (the `<module>`).
*   `os.makedirs(config["root"], exist_ok=True)`: This is the line of code causing the error. It calls the `makedirs` function from the `os` module, which is likely trying to create a directory. `exist_ok=True` means the code doesn't fail if the directory already exists.
*   `File "<frozen os>", line 227, in makedirs`: The traceback then goes into built-in functions of the operating system.
*   `PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/data'`: The core error: a permission error. The Python script does not have permission to create or access the '/data' directory, which is the root.

**In Summary:**
The terminal output reveals an attempt to execute a Python script (likely related to data generation) that is failing due to a permission error. The script, running in the user's environment and pulling data from a GitHub repository, tries to create a directory named `/data` but lacks the necessary permissions. This is a common problem, typically requiring adjustments to file permissions or the user's account settings to allow access to the target directory.

**Image Description:** The image presents a code snippet, likely related to a vector embedding database and a retrieval system. It is divided into two main parts, "Step 1: Store" (implicitly, based on the visible code) and "Step 2: Retrieve."

**Step 1: Store (Implied)**
*   **Purpose:** This section seems to describe the process of storing documents in a vector embedding database.
*   **Code Breakdown:**
    *   `for i, d in enumerate(documents):`: This loop iterates through a list or iterable of documents. For each document, the index `i` and the document content `d` are accessed.
    *   `response = ollama.embed(model="mxbai-embed-large", input=d)`: This line calls a function `ollama.embed` which presumably uses a model (specifically "mxbai-embed-large") to create an embedding for the document `d`.
    *   `embeddings = response["embeddings"]`: This extracts the actual vector embedding from the response.
    *   `collection.add(...)`: This adds the embedding and related information (e.g., document text) to a collection. Arguments:
        *   `ids=[str(i)]`: The document index `i` converted to a string, used as an identifier.
        *   `embeddings=embeddings`: The computed vector embedding.
        *   `documents=[d]`: The original document text.

**Step 2: Retrieve**
*   **Purpose:** This section illustrates how to retrieve a relevant document from the database given an input prompt.
*   **Text:**
    *   "Next, add the code to retrieve the most relevant document given an example prompt:"  This statement sets the context for this section.
*   **Code Breakdown:**
    *   `# an example input input = "What animals are llamas related to?"`: Defines an example input prompt that will be used to retrieve information from the database.
    *   `response = ollama.embed(model="mxbai-embed-large", input=prompt)`: It appears to embed the prompt using the same model as used for the document embeddings.
    *   `results = collection.query( query_embeddings=[response["embedding"]], n_results=1 )`: This performs a query on the vector database.
        *   `query_embeddings=[response["embedding"]]`: The embedding of the input prompt is used as the query vector.
        *   `n_results=1`: Only the most relevant result (the one with the closest vector) is requested.
    *   `data = results['documents'][0][0]`: This line accesses and retrieves the most relevant document's text, obtained via the `results` of the `collection.query()` function.

**Overall:** The image depicts code for creating a vector embedding database, populating it with document embeddings, and then retrieving relevant documents based on a given query, which also has to be embedded. The process appears to utilize the `ollama` library for embedding, and a `collection` for storing and querying the embeddings. It's a common pattern in information retrieval and question-answering applications.

**Image Description:** The image appears to be a title slide or presentation opener. Here's a detailed breakdown:

**Overall Composition:**

*   The image has a structured, possibly digital, aesthetic.
*   There are multiple layers of color, and geometric shapes are the primary design elements.

**Text:**

*   **"Week 5"**: This is the most prominent text, in a large, bold, white font.
*   **"Session 1"**: This text is below "Week 5," also in a large, bold, white font.

**Visual Elements / Icons:**

*   **Top Border**: The top portion of the image features a decorative band with numerous stylized icons. They appear to be associated with data, technology, and design. They include:
    *   A compass-like or targeting icon
    *   Arrows,
    *   A pencil.
    *   A stylized computer screen
    *   A circuit board-like design.
    *   Graph-like designs.
    *   Pencils or pens.
*   **Middle Area**:
    *   A rectangle or screen with lines, suggesting content like text or code.
    *   A globe with lines, implying global or international focus.
    *   A bar graph
    *   Other stylized icons
*   **Bottom Border:** The bottom portion has a few graph-like or design icons.
    *   A series of graphs with different colors.
    *   Scissors.
    *   A pie chart.
    *   More graphical elements.

**Color Palette:**

*   The dominant colors include shades of orange, blue, white, black, yellow, and green.

**Overall Impression:**

The image is likely for a presentation or educational material, possibly on a technical or data-related topic. The visual elements create a modern and professional feel, and the text clearly indicates the week and session number.

If I am not wrong, both the expected and actual result contain the same entries. It is just that the ordering is different. The expected result also doesnt follow any particular format (so does the actual result).


Kindly advise on this

EDIT
 : Resolved on a later evaluation

For the task - * 
B10
. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data


Do we have to handle prompts for converting CSV to JSON or for writing an endpoint for doing so?

## Post #149 by TRIGON (Post ID: 594069)
Dear Instructors (
@carlton
, 
@iamprasna
):


Confirming, just to be needfully pedantic:


It will 
solely
 be the responsibility of the Project Evaluator (human or machine) to parse the correct 
AIPROXY_TOKEN
 generated against my IITM email ID (presumably, per some database which holds all such generated 
AIPROXY_TOKEN
s of the students who have generated one); and the correct 
$IMAGE_NAME
 (to-be-submitted by myself in the Project Submission Google Form) in 
podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000
, correct?


Asking this seemingly obvious question, as (apparently) the actual 
AIPROXY_TOKEN
 is not to be included anywhere in the code, or the repository, or the dockerfile.

## Post #150 by Adithya (Post ID: 594074)
I am also facing the same issue, just that the ordering is different.

Sorting by keys also didn’t help.

Please help on this

sir will the tasks of Phase A and Phase B change? like currently do we need to make llm write the code for all tasks dynamically or can we write a pre defined python code to execute tasks after the llm parses the task and runs python code

That error is usually if you are using the wrong endpoint (ie. using open ai libraries instead of sending requests to aiproxy).


Without seeing the request its hard to tell you what the cause of the error is.


Kind regards

B10 → Create a service that creates a specified endpoint that receives a CSV and returns a JSON data . Where the JSON is expected, whether in the response body of the endpoint , or in a file will be specified by the task master

### Image Insight:
![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/4/6/463f25f29e9ac0e51e43914eb00cef2e89341c90_2_690x259.png)

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a terminal or code editor window. The background is dark, and the text is displayed in a light font. It shows the output of a task or script that involves formatting a markdown file using a tool named "prettier".

**Key elements and their analysis:**

1.  **Initial Task Description:**
    *   `Running task: Format the contents of '/data/format.md' using 'prettier@3.4.2', updating the file in-place`
    *   This line describes the task being performed. It indicates the goal is to format a markdown file named "format.md", located in the "/data/" directory, using a specific version of "prettier" (a code formatter) and to perform the formatting directly within the file.

2.  **HTTP Requests and Responses:**
    *   There are two HTTP interactions shown.  This suggests the script is likely using an API or web service.
    *   `HTTP Request: POST http://localhost:8000/... OK` This POST request is likely triggering the formatting operation on the specified file.
    *   `HTTP 200 { ... }` The `200 OK` response indicates success, providing detailed information about the POST request that was made.
    *   `"function": "format_file_with_prettier",` This suggests the API exposes a function named format\_file\_with\_prettier.
    *   `"arguments": { ... }` Shows the arguments sent to the function. The file path and prettier version are passed as arguments.
    *   `HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/format.md "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"` The GET request retrieves the contents of the formatted file after the POST request.
    *   `200 OK` Shows that the GET request was successful.

3.  **File Content & Formatting Result:**
    *   `/data/format.md` This line might be indicating the path of the markdown file being tested.
    *   `▲ EXPECTED:` This is the expected file contents before the formatting happens, as part of a test process.
    *   `▲ RESULT:` This indicates the result after formatting is done.
    *   `#Unformatted Markdown` Describes the expected state of the file (Unformatted Markdown).
    *   A sample markdown snippet:
        *   `This is a sample paragraph with extra spaces and trailing whitespace.`
        *   `- First item`
        *   `- Second item`
        *   `+Third item`
        *   `* Fourth item`
    *   This content hints that the markdown is not formatted as expected and has extra spaces and other issues. The formatted version would likely have cleaner formatting.

4.  **Footer:**
    *   `py`
    *   `print("user@example.com")`
    *   These lines at the very bottom indicate a small Python code snippet.  It may be used for a basic check or confirmation step, or part of the test script.

**In Summary:**

The image provides a glimpse into a test or automated workflow using a code formatter. The script is designed to run the formatter, likely "prettier", on a sample markdown file. It then checks whether the formatter has been applied by comparing the output of the formatting with the expected formatting of the file, or if the format function has been used correctly. If the formatting process is a success, then the user will be notified.

you mean screenshot of evaluate.py file?

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a code editor, likely VS Code, showing Python code. The editor uses a dark theme with syntax highlighting. The focus is on the code itself, with some helpful comments included.

**Specific Elements:**

*   **Code Structure:** The code is structured with functions. The code includes multiple functions called `a2` and `a3`.
*   **Code Content:**
    *   The primary code snippet within the focus of the image deals with formatting a file using "prettier@3.4.2".
    *   It calls on `subprocess.run` to execute `npx prettier@3.4.2`.
    *   There are lines involving  `read`, and `return mismatch`.
    *   The code seems related to processing emails (`email` is a variable).
*   **Syntax Highlighting:** The code uses color-coding to differentiate keywords, strings, function names, and comments, which is standard for code editors.
*   **Comments:** Comments start with a `#` and provide clarifying context for the code.
*   **Editor Features:**
    *   Line numbers are present on the left side (e.g., 79, 80).
    *   The image shows "PROBLEMS", "OUTPUT", "DEBUG CONSOLE", "TERMINAL" in the bottom bar which are typical editor features. The "TERMINAL" is highlighted (appears active/selected).
    *   There are "PORTS" available in the editor as well.
*   **Formatting/Style:** The code seems well-formatted, as in, it has consistent indentation.
*   **File Path:** The file path referenced in the code includes "/data/format.md".

**Possible Questions the Image Could Answer:**

*   What language is the code written in (Python)?
*   What is the purpose of the code (It deals with formatting Markdown files and potentially email processing)?
*   What tool is used for formatting (prettier@3.4.2)?
*   Is the code related to using `subprocess` or how `npx` is run.
*   Where does the script run in an editor such as VSCode?

@Jivraj

could you please help me out on how to start with TDS Project-1, as I am stuck at the moment and don’t know where to start from. This project is very much unfamiliar for me and I need some guidance on how to start with it. It would be really great if you could provide some help through resources/materials/videos and help me complete the project. Thanks in advance!

## Post #166 by 23f1002382 (Post ID: 594169)
issue with evaluate py, specifically , how it formats the file, maybe shell=True should be uncommented if commented out. then im not sure. Im not in composing docker files yet

## Post #168 by 21f2000709 (Post ID: 594189)
My final docker image size is coming 1.25 gb, I am using the ubuntu base image as I thought it would be appropriate given the tasks. Is it ok with that size?


PS - Also I would be running out of token if I need to test again with some other base image now.

You do not need the whole of ubuntu!


Just python and uv


More like 128mb image.


Please watch Tues week 5 session 1


Kind regards

## Post #172 by 21f2000709 (Post ID: 594196)
I could pull it down to 610 mb, using python:3.9-slim now, but there are some essential libraries that is needed which is taking up the space…will it be ok? I mean installing on the go with uv might lead to timeout during evaluation…

How did you corrected it ?

## Post #174 by 21f2000709 (Post ID: 594210)
I tried cutting it down further but it is affecting the functionality, this is the best I can do, i.e., 610 mb

Sir in main.py file I’m defining task with different variables . But in evaluate.py tasks are defined by different variables to test and when I’m testing it using python evaluate.py it returns unsuccessful . I’m testing all my tasks of main.py with Postman it returns successful.

My query is that how the tasks get evaluated and do i need to change my variables in main.py ? And what are the other things i have to change.

Also plss update evaluate.py fie with phase B tasks

Hi instructors and TAs,

For the different tasks in Phase B, I don’t have a clear idea of what type of a response you expect.


eg.




Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database & Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website & Transcribe audio from an MP3 file - Do you want the query’s response on an output file like A10? or as a response?




I understand that these are broad problems you except us to solve, but it would be helpful to know what type of response you would require.


Thanks,

Trebhuvan

 that’s an email address.


You need to download both

datagen.py
 in same folder and then execute 
evaluate.py
 using uv.


uv run evaluate.py --email $any_email
.

Hi 
@23f1002382

This is the classic case where you use Prompt engineering to solve your problems. I assume you have already achieved your answers, but I want to clarify this for someone who is facing this problem.


The thing is GPT-4o-mini is intelligent enough to understand what kind of task you are asking it do, and extracting Credit Card info from an image is one of the many prohibited tasks.


What you can do is, 
try to fool it using itself.
 Just ask ChatGPT to generate a prompt that would be capable of fooling itself into extracting out that credit card info. I was capable of doing it after pretending to be a working on a Cyber Security project, and other fake details which ChatGPT itself provided me with.

Command to run the image in the docs, seemed to have some error,




The command:


podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000


gives the error:


crun: executable file `-e` not found in $PATH: No such file or directory: OCI runtime attempted to invoke a command that was not found


However the correct command seems to be:


podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN="$AIPROXY_TOKEN" -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME


This works totally fine.

**Image Description:** The image is a snippet of text, presumably from a documentation or tutorial. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Bullet point:** The text starts with a bullet point, suggesting it's part of a list.
*   **Instruction:** The main content is a command-line instruction to run a Docker (or similar) image using `podman`.
*   **`podman run` command:** The command starts with `podman run`, indicating the use of Podman for running containerized applications.
*   **`$IMAGE_NAME`:**  This is a placeholder for the actual image name, which will be replaced with the name of the containerized application's image.
*   **`-e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN`:** This part sets an environment variable named `AIPROXY_TOKEN` inside the container. The value is retrieved from a similarly named environment variable outside the container.
*   **`-p 8000:8000`:** This command maps port 8000 on the host machine to port 8000 inside the container. This is a port mapping configuration.
*   **`automatically serves the API at http://localhost:8000/run?task=...`:** This describes that the container serves an API at the given URL.
*   **`and`**: Shows the continuation of something else to describe.

In summary, this text snippet provides instructions on how to run an application image using podman, including setting environment variables and port mapping. It also mentions the URL where the application's API will be accessible.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/f/cf9060b0880a8d94e57a14ce300b4dcc714ed117.png)

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall:** The image displays a terminal output, likely from a command-line interface, running a program or container. The background is dark, and the text is white.

**Text and Commands:**

*   **User and Machine Context:** The top line shows the user, machine name, and the current directory. It starts with "pradeepmondal.iitm@Pradeeps-MacBook-Air llm-based-automation-agent %" indicating the terminal prompt. This line gives the user context with their username and hostname.
*   **Podman Run Command:** The core of the displayed command is "podman run -e AIPROXY\_TOKEN="$AIPROXY\_TOKEN" -p 8000:8000 tds-project-pradeep-mondal". This command is using `podman` (a container management tool) to run a container:
    *   `-e AIPROXY_TOKEN="$AIPROXY_TOKEN"`: Sets an environment variable named `AIPROXY_TOKEN`.
    *   `-p 8000:8000`: Maps port 8000 of the container to port 8000 on the host machine.
    *   `tds-project-pradeep-mondal`:  The name or ID of the container image to be run.
*   **Informational Output:** The rest of the output consists of INFO messages:
    *   "Started server process \[1]": Indicates that a server process has started.
    *   "Waiting for application startup.": Shows that the program is waiting for the application to start.
    *   "Application startup complete.": Indicates the application has finished starting up.
    *   "Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)": This is an indicator that the application is running using the Uvicorn server and the IP address and port that it is listening on. The output states that to close the program, a user needs to press CTRL+C

**Objects and Features:**

*   **Terminal Interface:**  The entire image is an output from a terminal program.
*   **Status Messages:** The "INFO:" prefixes clearly indicate the status of various processes, especially concerning the start-up and running status of an application inside the container.
*   **IP Address and Port:** The text "http://0.0.0.0:8000" provides the access address of the application.

**Overall Meaning:**

The image shows the successful execution of a container using Podman, with an application running inside, likely a web service, accessible on port 8000. The initial setup, including the container starting and application initialization is displayed by the status messages.

**Image Description:** The image is a screenshot of a terminal session. The terminal is displaying the output of a command run within a Docker container environment, specifically using `podman`.

Here is a breakdown of the key elements:

*   **Command Execution:** The session begins with the command `podman run 20511982f949`. This indicates the user is attempting to run a Docker container with a specific ID (20511982f949).

*   **Error Message:** The command then displays a traceback and a `ModuleNotFoundError`. The error message is: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`. This indicates a Python script is trying to import a library named `fastapi`, but the library isn't installed within the container's environment.

*   **File and Line Number:** The traceback shows that the error occurs within the file `/app/app.py` on line 1. This means that the Python script `/app/app.py` is the code attempting to import `fastapi`.

*   **User and Directory:** The terminal prompt `vikramjncasr@ANJANEYA:/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project$` indicates the current user, the machine name, and the current directory. The directory structure suggests a project likely resides within `/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project`.

*   **Environment:** The use of `podman run` suggests the code is being executed within a containerized environment, which could mean the environment is isolated from the host system.

In summary, the image shows an attempt to run a container with a Python script that relies on the `fastapi` library, which is currently not installed within the container. The user needs to install this library inside the container to solve the issue.

**Image Description:** The image shows the output from a terminal or console, likely running a Python application. Let's break down the key elements:

*   **Command Execution:** The terminal prompt `PS C:\IIT_Madras\TDS_Project>` indicates the current working directory. The key command executed is `uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000`.
    *   `uvicorn`: This is a Python web server implementation for ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) applications, often used for projects built with frameworks like FastAPI or Starlette.
    *   `app:app`: This specifies the application module and the application object within that module. For example, it indicates that within a file named `app.py`, there is a function or object called `app` that serves as the entry point for the web application.
    *   `--host 127.0.0.1`: This sets the host address to bind the server to. `127.0.0.1` is the local machine's loopback address, meaning the server will be accessible only from the same machine it's running on.
    *   `--port 8000`: This sets the port number the server listens on, in this case, port 8000.

*   **Status Messages (INFO):**  The output is peppered with informational messages, prefixed with "INFO:", providing the following details:
    *   "Finished server process \[30576]": A previous server process likely finished with a specific process ID.
    *   "Started server process \[5584]": A new server process was started, with a process ID.
    *   "Waiting for application startup." and "Application startup complete.": Indicates that the Uvicorn server is waiting for the underlying application to initialize, and then successfully initializes the application.
    *   "Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)": Confirms that the server is running and provides the URL to access it.
    *   "127.0.0.1:54184 - "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 OK": This suggests that a GET request was made to the root path ("/") of the web application, and the server responded with a 200 OK status code. This means the request was successful.

*   **General Interpretation:**  The image indicates that a Python web application is being run using Uvicorn. The application is successfully started, running on port 8000 on the local machine, and is responding to HTTP requests.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Structure:**

The image displays a computer screen with a split layout.  The left side shows a web browser, while the right side features a code editor (likely Visual Studio Code) and a terminal.

**Left Side: Web Browser**

*   **Browser Window:** A web browser is open. The URL bar shows `http://localhost:5000`.
*   **Page Content:** The browser displays the text `{"detail": "Not Found"}`. This indicates an API endpoint at localhost:5000 was accessed, and a 404 (Not Found) error was returned.
*   **Title Bar:** The browser has tabs, one of them is labelled with "Live Session"

**Right Side: Code Editor and Terminal**

*   **Code Editor (Visual Studio Code):**
    *   The code editor is open with multiple files.
    *   Main file: The file `app.py` is open in the main view. This likely contains the code for a web application (likely using FastAPI), given the import statements for `FastAPI`, `HTTPException`, `Query`, `PlainTextResponse`, and `logging`.
    *   Other Files: There are other files open in tabs, including `README.md`, `Dockerfile`, `.gitignore`, and `evaluate.py`.
    *   Code Snippets: The code shows:
        *   Lines checking for an environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN` and raising an exception if not found.
        *   A function `read_root` returning a message "Hello from the Automation Agent!".
        *   An API endpoint `@app.get("/")` using FastAPI.
        *   An API endpoint `@app.delete("/delete", response_class=PlainTextResponse)`.
        *   Configuration for logging using `logging.basicConfig` and `logging.getLogger`.
*   **Terminal:** A terminal window is present at the bottom of the code editor.
    *   Git Commands: The terminal output shows `git push origin main`. This indicates that the user is pushing changes to a remote Git repository.
    *   Git Output: The terminal output provides information about the git push process:
        *   "3 files changed, 23 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)"
        *   Commands like "Enumerating objects", "Counting objects", "Delta compression", "writing objects", and "Resolving deltas."
        *   The final line indicates the push was successful, with the destination of the repo being `https://github.com/Ansh205/LLM_project.git`.
    *   Environment Information: The terminal prompt indicates that the current directory is within a Python virtual environment named `llm_project`. The prompt also has the user's name.

**Key Observations and Context:**

*   **Development Environment:** The image clearly showcases a software development workflow, involving writing code, running a web server (localhost:5000), and using Git for version control.
*   **Web Application Development:** The code and browser content strongly suggest that the user is developing a web application, possibly using FastAPI.
*   **Error Handling:** The `{"detail": "Not Found"}` message in the browser is a common response to indicate that a specific URL that was requested wasn't found.
*   **Project Type:** The presence of `Dockerfile` suggests the project might be designed to be containerized, possibly using Docker.
*   **Python Project:** Python is being used, based on the code imports, the `FastAPI` library, and the Python version info visible in the terminal.

In summary, the image depicts a developer working on a Python web application, likely running it locally and pushing changes to a Git repository. The user is likely testing an API endpoint. The error in the browser ("Not Found") means that the requested page or endpoint was not available.

I am also facing the same issue.

Evaluation Output:

🔴 A9 failed: 'data'

❌ A9 FAILED



I sense ‘Authentication Problem’ happens only with the evaluation script, as the curl requests seems to work fine.

**Image Description:** Here is a detailed description of the image:

**Overall:**

The image shows a terminal window, likely in a Linux environment, displaying an error message resulting from an attempt to run a Python script.

**Specific Elements:**

1.  **Terminal Prompt:** At the top, the prompt shows a virtual environment named `(tds-project-1)` followed by the username `vidushilinux@swastivivo` and the current directory `~/tds-project-1`. This implies the user is working within a project named "tds-project-1".

2.  **Command Execution:** The command `uv run app.py` is entered, indicating an attempt to execute the python script named `app.py` using the `uv` package manager.

3.  **Traceback:**
    *   A traceback is generated, which is common when errors occur in Python.
    *   It begins with "Traceback (most recent call last):". This signals that the most recent error occurred last in the sequence.
    *   File: The error is traced to a file `/home/vidushilinux/tds-project-1/app.py` on line 9, within the `<module>` context.
    *   Import Statement: Line 9 is shown to be attempting to import `FastAPI` from `fastapi`
    *   Error Message: It concludes with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`.  This is the core issue. The Python interpreter cannot find the `fastapi` package.

**Interpretation:**

The user is likely trying to run a Python application that uses the `fastapi` library, but the library isn't installed or available in the current environment. The traceback confirms an import error. This means the user will likely need to install the "fastapi" package, maybe using `pip install fastapi`.

**Image Description:** The image shows a terminal window in a Linux environment. The user "vikramjncasr" is logged into a system called "ANJANEYA". The current working directory is "/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project_1". The user has executed the "ls /" command, which lists the contents of the root directory ("/").

Hello Sir 
@carlton
 
@Jivraj

What are implications on missing the project 1.

Due to some personal reasons I wasn’t able to start any work on my project 1. It seems difficult for me to complete it.

Could you please tell what will be the implications of missing it. Will I in anyway be able to cover up and pass in the subject doing future assignments and projects?


Thank you

Now when i try to use podman using the wsl via the code “sudo apt install -y podman” it is asking for the password…

The problem is:




I haven’t set any password for podman earlier.


Though it is asking for password but it is not taking any input.(ie I am unable type anything there).

what should I am supposed to do…

**Image Description:** The image shows a terminal window within a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) interface. The terminal displays a series of commands and output related to using the `sudo` command, which indicates an attempt to run commands with elevated privileges.

Here's a breakdown of the content:

*   **Terminal Output:** The terminal displays text lines, which are primarily attempts to authenticate with sudo. It appears the user is repeatedly entering the wrong password for the account `ayushcodes2611`. The output clearly shows "Sorry, try again." and "sudo: 3 Incorrect password attempts" after multiple failed attempts. Additionally, the output reads "sudo: a password is required" each time the user attempts to run a sudo command. Further commands executed include `sudo apt update`, `sudo passad`, and `sudo apt install -y podman` .

*   **VS Code Interface:** The interface is characteristic of VS Code, as seen by the top bar with menu options and the sidebar on the right. The sidebar shows tabs labeled `powershell` and `wsl`.

In summary, the image demonstrates a user's attempts to run sudo commands in a Linux environment from within a VS Code terminal, where they appear to be having issues providing the correct password, which prevents them from updating or installing programs.

Should I give the same url now and then carry on updating the app.py

Or, Should first complete and then upload in the form!

**Image Description:** The image is a terminal output showing the execution of a task that involves extracting a credit card number from an image. Here's a detailed breakdown:

**1. Initial Task Description:**
*   The task is to process an image located at `/data/credit_card.png` which contains a credit card number.
*   The task includes:
    *   Passing the image to a Large Language Model (LLM).
    *   Instructing the LLM to extract the credit card number.
    *   Writing the extracted number to a file named `/data/credit-card.txt`, without any spaces.

**2. HTTP Request and Error:**
*   **POST Request:**  The script sends a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/run`.  The request URL contains the task description, including references to the credit card image and the output file.
*   **HTTP 500 Internal Server Error:**  The response from the server is an "HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error," indicating a problem on the server's side.
*   **Error Detail:** The error message provides more details.  Specifically,  it states: `"Error extracting credit card: Image file .C:\\Users\\starb\\Desktop\\tds_p_1\\data\\credit_card.png does not exist."` This indicates that the program is unable to find the credit card image.

**3. Second HTTP Request and Error:**
*   **GET Request:** Another HTTP request is sent, this time a GET request to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/credit-card.txt`. The request is attempting to read the content of the `/data/credit-card.txt` file.
*   **HTTP 404 Not Found:** The server responds with an "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found" error.  This means that the requested file (`/data/credit-card.txt`) does not exist on the server (which is expected if the extraction failed).
*   **Failure Indication (A8):** The output indicates that it *failed* to read `/data/credit-card.txt`, and is marked as "A8 failed."
*   **Overall Failure (X A8 FAILED):** The process A8 is marked as a "FAIL".

**4. Third HTTP Request and Error:**
*   **POST Request:** This request is sent to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`.
*   **HTTP 401 Unauthorized:** The response indicates that the request is "HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized", so it is not authorized.
*   **Failure Indication (A9):** The output indicates that it *failed* to read 'data'.
*   **Overall Failure (X A9 FAILED):** The process A9 is marked as a "FAIL".

**5. Overall Assessment:**
*   The primary issue is the inability to locate the credit card image file.
*   Because of the image not being available, the rest of the process fails.
*   There seems to be some attempts to communicate with other services, likely related to some form of data processing. However these calls also failed because of authorization reasons.

In summary, the image shows a sequence of attempts to process a credit card image and write the result to a file.  The key failures are:
1.  The image file does not exist.
2.  The attempts to read and use data also failed.

**Image Description:** The image is a graphic design presentation slide. It's framed within a rectangular orange border. Overlaid on top of the design is a large, dark blue rectangular shape. The text "WEEK 5 SESSION 1" is prominently displayed in white, bold font inside the blue rectangle.  

Around the text, above and below, are several illustrative icons. The upper area has a series of icons that appear to represent technology and education. There are circles with crosshairs, triangles, a tablet, a network graphic, and pencils.

The lower area below the text includes graphic elements that may represent data or analysis. These include a bar graph, a line chart, and a pie chart. The whole design suggests a presentation about a session of a particular week, potentially focusing on data, technology, and education.

**Image Description:** Certainly! Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Appearance:**

The image features a stylized digital representation, specifically the logo of the popular video-sharing platform, YouTube. It's recognizable due to its iconic elements.

**Key Elements:**

*   **Shape:** The logo is enclosed within a red, slightly rounded-rectangular shape. The corners of the rectangle are smoothed, giving it a soft, modern look.
*   **Inner Element:** Inside the red shape is a white, right-pointing triangle. This is the primary play button symbol.
*   **Color:** The primary colors are red, white and a slight red shading around the outer part of the rectangle, which is consistent with the YouTube branding.

**Potential Uses:**

The image, as a YouTube logo, is intended for use when referring to the platform or linking to YouTube videos.

Let me know if you have any more questions about the image!

 sir,


I’m getting the following error while post mapping, I couldn’t able to fix it.

I’m getting status code as 400 from the llm api response. How to fix it sir?


   "json": {

There is some problem with the json that you are using.


Try to debug it with GPT.

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with an error message.  

**Key Features and Objects:**

*   **VS Code Interface:** The general dark theme and the presence of code hints at a coding environment within VS Code.
*   **Error Message:** A pop-up dialog box in the center of the screen displays the message "The window is not responding". The message is accompanied by a yellow warning triangle icon.
*   **Error Message Options:** The dialog box provides three options: "Reopen," "Close," and "Keep Waiting." There is also a checkbox "Don't restore editors."
*   **Code Snippet:** Part of a code snippet is visible in the background, including "os.environ.get("AIPROXY"..." This indicates that the user was likely working on Python code.
*   **Terminal:** A terminal window is present at the bottom of the VS Code window. The prompt reads "TERMINAL" along with the "powershell" icon.

**In Summary:** The image depicts a common scenario in software development: a program (VS Code) becomes unresponsive, and the user is prompted to resolve the issue by either closing, reopening, or waiting for the program to recover. The user was likely working on Python code within VS Code at the time of the crash.

Hello 
@carlton
 
@Jivraj
 
@Saransh_Saini
 sir, I have implemented the code for B3 & B6 but unfortunately as per the instructions given in project for B3 & B6 —






B6
. Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website






B3
. Fetch data from an API and save it






They are almost similar and it’s getting confusing in both cases, it’s given output based on B3 and not reading the input for B6, so could you please help me out with this?


Is anyone else facing this or a similar issue?

---

## Post #269 by Jivraj (Post ID: 594890)
Two solutions




give proper permissions.


use docker containers this is what we will test on.




I would prefer 2nd approach

---

## Post #271 by Jivraj (Post ID: 594892)
For B tasks use LLM to write code on the fly and execute it, use better prompts. In evaluation script detailed task will be provided with what data needs to be scraped, endpoints, parameters, etc.

## Post #274 by Saransh_Saini (Post ID: 594899)
Hi,

If you read these questions carefully then they are not similar, one is asking you to extract data from a webpage, meaning you have to do something related to the HTML code. And the other is simply sending a request to a given endpoint.

## Post #275 by 22f2001640 (Post ID: 594912)
Hi 
@carlton
 
@Saransh_Saini
 
@Jivraj
 ,

In task A6


Find all Markdown (
.md
 ) files in 
/data/docs/
 . For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with 
# 
 ). Create an index file 
/data/docs/index.json
 that maps each filename (without the 
/data/docs/
 prefix) to its title (e.g. 
{"README.md": "Home", "path/to/large-language-models.md": "Large Language Models", ...}
 ).


Here expected output JSON “key” is file name or file path without prefix /data/docs/ as prompt is bit confusing . when “path/to/large-language-models.md” is given in example is actually referring to file path or filename itself is “path/to/large-language-models.md”.

---

## Post #276 by Saransh_Saini (Post ID: 594917)
This can easily be checked by runing the evaluate.py file.

Anyways, a file present in data/docs/folder_a/folder_b/md_file should be folder_a/folder_b/md_file as key.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a webpage displaying pricing information, likely related to API usage for language models. The background is a dark, minimalist style, with information presented in two columns or cards.

**Header & Navigation:**

*   **URL:** The URL in the browser's address bar is "openai.com/api/pricing/," indicating the pricing page for OpenAI's API.
*   **Navigation:** The top-right of the screen displays an icon, possibly for settings or account access, and a "Log in" button. The presence of a search icon also suggests the ability to search on the page.

**Content (Pricing Information):**

The main content focuses on the pricing for two different language models:

*   **GPT-4o:**
    *   **Description:** "High-intelligence model for complex tasks | 128k context length"
    *   **Pricing:**
        *   Input: $2.50 / 1M tokens
        *   Cached Input: $1.25 / 1M tokens
        *   Output: $10.00 / 1M tokens

*   **GPT-4o mini:**
    *   **Description:** "Affordable small model for fast, everyday tasks | 128k context length"
    *   **Pricing:**
        *   Input: $0.150 / 1M tokens
        *   Cached Input: $0.075 / 1M tokens
        *   Output: $0.600 / 1M tokens

**Other Features:**

*   **Interactive Element:** At the bottom of the image, there is a button that says "Ask ChatGPT" and a up-facing arrow. This feature is likely meant to direct the user to a chat interface to utilize OpenAI's product.

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a clear and concise presentation of the pricing for different OpenAI language models. The design is clean and easy to read, making it straightforward for users to understand the cost of using these APIs.

*   **Icon:** To the right of the project title is a square with rounded corners containing a pixelated green tree-like graphic.
*   **Statistics:** Beneath the title, there are statistics indicating the project's activity:
    *   **Contributors:** "2" contributors.
    *   **Issues:** "0" issues.
    *   **Stars:** "1" star.
    *   **Forks:** "0" forks.
*   **GitHub Logo:** In the bottom right corner there is the GitHub logo, the octocat. This further suggests the project is hosted on GitHub.

**Inferences:**

*   This is a project repository on a code hosting platform.
*   The project is likely under active development or has been completed but is not heavily maintained.
*   The pixelated tree icon might be the project's logo.
*   The lack of issues and forks indicates a relatively small project.

If you have any specific questions about the image, please ask!

For as task description like this




Write the # of Thursdays in 
/data/extracts.txt
 into 
/data/extracts-count.txt




I have given the prompt in such detail to the LLM but it is still not able to understand the task because of the “#” symbol. The task is getting truncated even before it reaches to the LLM.

Can anyone help me on this because I have tried so many things to fix this but nothing seems to help.

@Jivraj

sir i have tried to solve the A1. when I want to check the solution we are asked for the datagen module as the evaluate.py have

’


''from datagen import (
    get_markdown,
    get_dates,
    get_contacts,
    get_logs,
    get_docs,
    get_email,
    get_credit_card,
    get_comments,
    get_tickets,
)
'''



so do we need to download the datagen.py in the local system first…


Or it should be the part of the automation only…

I am getting internal server error for task A1, I have been trying for a long time. It may be possible that i have issues with my ai_proxy token thus tell how to properly set the taken.

---

## Post #289 by 23f2002592 (Post ID: 594973)
Yes I know that but LLM does not know that # indicates number. And no prompt is fixing this issue because the task has to be passed as query parameter and by the time LLM reads the task, it is already half gone due to #.

### Image Insight:
![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/b/dbd85efd1bbce9710794cb0434a90d37a8c20a25.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a terminal output within a code editor interface, likely VS Code, judging by the tab titles and the UI layout. The code editor displays a Python file, `main.py`.  

The code defines a function `handle_task_A2` which takes a file path and a prettier version as input.  It checks if the file path exists using `os.path.exists(file_path)`. If the file exists, it prints a message indicating that prettier will be performed and then uses `subprocess.run` to execute prettier on the given file. If the file does not exist, a `FileNotFoundError` is raised.

Below the code, the terminal output shows a test scenario involving a file named `/data/format.md`. The output presents an "EXPECTED" section, showing how the markdown file is supposed to look. Then it showcases the "RESULT" which is how the markdown file looks after running a process, presumably the `prettier` tool, as indicated in the python code. It appears that prettier is used to format markdown files. The before and after text output displays markdown code, including bullet points and a sample paragraph with extra spaces, showcasing the intended formatting outcome.

Okay, actually when i tried with local, i’m facing path error


./data/format.md
[WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified



So that’s why i moved to docker but there also i’m getting error for A2.

---

## Post #302 by daksh76 (Post ID: 594993)
you should manually check if the file really exists or not because i think the code and the folder where datagen.py is downloading files(data folder) are different

---

## Post #303 by 23f2005419 (Post ID: 594997)
yes yes i moved the folder to current working directory

---

## Post #304 by carlton (Post ID: 595006)
If you are using the function calling approach, you could just parse the ‘#’ and change it to ‘number’ and then send the prompt to the llm for that particular task.


Or another approach is tell the llm,


If you ever see the phrase ‘count the # of’ in a task, please interpret it as ‘count the number of’. For example

Count the # of Fridays means

Count the number of Fridays

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/3/d/3dacf2bf3fd48309342a483aeb249f46faf1dc55_2_690x364.png)

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Layout:**

The image shows a screenshot of the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor. It's primarily focused on a Python script (`llm.py`) and the terminal output below. There are various panels and UI elements visible, showcasing the development environment.

**Editor Panel (Left side):**

*   **Explorer:** The left side of the editor displays the file explorer, showing a file structure with the following files and folders:
    *   `__pycache__` (folder)
    *   `lim_venv` (folder)
    *   `.env` (folder)
    *   `apy` (file)
    *   `app.py` (file)
    *   `Dockerfile` (file)
    *   `llm.py` (file) - This is the file that's actively being edited.
    *   `re.txt` (file)
*   **Outline:**  This panel seems to be collapsed.
*   **Timeline:** This panel seems to be collapsed.

**Editor Panel (Right side):**

*   **llm.py (Tab):** The primary focus of the image. This file is open in the editor window.
    *   **Code Content:**
        *   The code is a Python script.
        *   **Line 1-4:** The code is commented out with a header indicating the file is a script, and includes requirements, such as a `required-python` to be greater than or equal to 3.11, and a description.
        *   **Line 7:** Imports the `subprocess` module.
        *   **Lines 10-12:** Defines `script_url` and `arg` variables related to a file hosted on a GitHub repository (`raw.githubusercontent.com`).
        *   **Lines 14-16:**  Uses the `wget` command and `subprocess.run` to download a script.
        *   **Lines 17-18:** Uses `subprocess.run` again to execute the downloaded Python script (`datagen.py`) with the specified argument (`arg`).

**Terminal Panel (Bottom):**

*   **Output:**  The terminal is open and displaying output, likely from running the Python script.
    *   **Logs:** The output includes various INFO messages (HTTP requests to a local server), indicating the execution of a task (possibly a web request related to a data file) with "200 OK" status.
    *   **Errors:** The terminal shows a traceback with `NameError: name 'subprocess' is not defined. Did you forget to import subprocess?` This implies that the `subprocess` module was not imported, likely leading to the error.

**Overall Context and Functionality:**

The user is likely attempting to:

1.  Run a Python script (`datagen.py`) which will be downloaded, using subprocess.
2.  The script is designed to interact with a file located on GitHub.
3.  The `llm.py` script retrieves the file and runs the Python file which produces an error.

**Other UI Elements:**

*   **Top Bar:** Contains the standard VS Code menu items like "File," "Edit," "View," "Go," "Run," "Terminal," and "Help."
*   **Status Bar (Bottom):** Displays information about the environment such as the current workspace, the language mode (Python), the indentation settings (Spaces: 4), and the line/column position of the cursor. The "podman-LUM\_1+" label probably indicates a development environment using Podman containers. There is a WSL: Ubuntu-24.04 indicator.

**Possible Issues:**

*   The primary issue is the "NameError" in the terminal output.  The error message suggests that the user forgot to import the `subprocess` module, as the code calls subprocess which is correct, but there is an import statement with no other imports.
*   The file path may be incorrect, as the error may be caused by an issue in the original `llm.py` file, or the method by which it is trying to download the file.

In summary, the image documents the user working with Python scripts within VS Code, attempting to download and run another script, but encountering an error likely due to a missing import statement, file path, or other source code-related problems.

## Post #309 by carlton (Post ID: 595026)
Please read the deliverables and evalute section.


datagen.py and evaluate.py were for only for your testing purposes so that you have an idea of the workflow and how the evaluation works. They are NOT part of your project submission.


Only DO what the project page tells you in the deliverables and evalute sections.


Kind regards

**Image Description:** The image is a text-based output, likely from a terminal or command-line interface, and displays a Python traceback. 

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Traceback:** The text begins with "Traceback (most recent call last):", indicating an error occurred during the execution of a Python program.
*   **File:** The next line specifies the file where the error originated: "/app/app.py", line 11, in <module>. This indicates the error happened within the "app.py" file, specifically on line 11.
*   **Import Statement:** The subsequent line is "from fastapi import FastAPI". This line indicates that the program is trying to import the "FastAPI" class from the "fastapi" module.
*   **Error Message:** Finally, the error message is "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'". This is the core of the problem: the Python interpreter cannot find the "fastapi" module, which is required for the program to run.

**In summary:** The image presents a "ModuleNotFoundError" in a Python script, indicating that the "fastapi" library is not installed or accessible in the current environment.

Hey 
@carlton
 
@Jivraj
 , I actually submitted the project already in the morning,

I included all the deliverables and things mentioned in the evaluation section.


But since I was actively testing with the - 
datagen.py
 and 
evaluate.py
, I forgot to remove them before submission.


However these files do not play a role in my project execution in any way, they just sit idle. Will there be any issue?

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Layout**

The image displays the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) IDE, likely on a Linux system, given the "WSL: Ubuntu-24.04" in the top bar. The user is working on a Python script.

**Left Panel (Explorer)**

*   The left side of the screen shows the file explorer. Several files and directories are listed:
    *   `__pycache__`
    *   `__venv`
    *   `app.py`
    *   `datagen.py`
    *   `Dockerfile`
    *   `lm.py` (the currently open file)
    *   `re.txt`

**Central Panel (Editor)**

*   The central part of the screen is dedicated to the code editor, showing the content of `lm.py`.
*   **Code Content:** The Python script appears to be designed to:
    *   Import `os` and `subprocess` modules.
    *   Print the absolute path of the `/data` directory.
    *   Download a Python script from a URL (likely `datagen.py` from GitHub).
    *   Execute the downloaded script (presumably `datagen.py`) using `uv` as a runtime/executor, with the `email_arg` parameter.
*   **Key Lines:**
    *   `script_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py'` (line 20)
    *   `email_arg = "21f3002277@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"` (line 21)
    *   `response = subprocess.run(['curl', '-O', script_url], check=True)` (line 24) - downloads the script.
    *   `subprocess.run(['uv', 'run', 'datagen.py', email_arg], check=True)` (line 27) - executes the script with the email argument.

**Bottom Panels**

*   **Output Panel:** Below the code editor is the output panel, which is displaying the output from running the Python script. The output indicates:
    *   The application started successfully, and Uvicorn is running.
    *   Information about the completion of the script.
    *   Some HTTP request output.
    *   A DISCLAIMER regarding the changing script code is visible.

*   **Terminal:** The very bottom shows the terminal session. The terminal shows the command used to run the script and some output details: "CompletedProcess(args=...'uv', 'run', 'llm.py']...".

**Top Panel**

*   The top menu bar displays typical IDE options: File, Edit, Selection, View, Go, Run, Terminal, Help.

**Overall context:** The user appears to be executing a Python script (`lm.py`) that downloads and then executes another Python script (`datagen.py`). The `datagen.py` script takes an email address as an argument. The output suggests that Uvicorn, a Python web server, is being used and that HTTP requests are being made. The script is running on a WSL Ubuntu environment.

### Image Insight:
![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/d/2/d2cb339eab8983304f220c258a57f4db8cd76213_2_690x365.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) window with a Dockerfile open and a terminal at the bottom. The Dockerfile seems to be configuring a Docker image for a Python application. Here's a detailed breakdown:

**File Explorer:**

*   On the left, there's an Explorer panel. The following file and directory structure can be seen:
    *   `LLM_1 (WSL: Ubuntu-24.04)` (Likely the project's name)
        *   `__pycache__` (a directory, likely containing compiled Python files)
        *   `app.py` (a Python file)
        *   `datagen.py` (another Python file)
        *   `Dockerfile` (the file currently open in the editor)
        *   `im.py` (another Python file)

**Dockerfile Contents:**

*   The editor window displays the contents of the Dockerfile. Here is a breakdown of key lines and their purpose:
    *   `FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm`: This line specifies the base image for the Docker container, which is a slim version of Python 3.12 based on Debian "Bookworm."
    *   `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates`: This line updates the package index and installs `curl` (a command-line tool for transferring data with URLs) and `ca-certificates` (for SSL/TLS support).
    *   `ADD https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh /uv-installer.sh`: This line downloads the `uv-installer.sh` installer and places it in the image.
    *   `RUN sh /uv-installer.sh && rm /uv-installer.sh`: This line executes the `uv-installer.sh` script and then removes it after execution.  The  `uv` suggests a  tool like  `uv` is being used.
    *   `ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin/:$PATH"`: This line adds a directory to the `PATH` environment variable so that the tools installed in the previous step will be accessible.
    *   `WORKDIR /app`: This line sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`.
    *   `COPY re.txt /app`: This copies a file named `re.txt` into the `/app` directory.
    *   `RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r re.txt`: This line installs Python packages based on the content of `re.txt`. The `--no-cache-dir` option prevents caching.
    *   `RUN mkdir -p /data`: This line creates the `/data` directory.
    *   `COPY app.py /app`: This copies `app.py` into `/app`.
    *   `CMD ["uv", "run", "app.py"]`: This line specifies the command to run when the container starts, which seems to use `uv run app.py`.  Based on other steps, this is likely running a python server using the `app.py` application.

**Terminal Window:**

*   The terminal is at the bottom, showing the output of a command that was run.
    *   It looks like the command  `python app.py`  was initiated, and a Uvicorn server is running on  `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.  This suggests that the `app.py` file runs a web application.
    *   There is information on the terminal about the running and completion of various processes
    *   There are also INFO messages with HTTP request data.
    *   The terminal's current directory seems to be `/mnt/e/11/New/TDS/LLM`.

**Overall:**

The image depicts the configuration and execution of a Python application using Docker. The `Dockerfile` sets up the environment, installs dependencies, copies the necessary files, and defines the command to run the application. The terminal output shows the application starting, along with the Uvicorn server, suggesting a web application.

i too got the same error you can change the the tools part in your payload to


"tools": [{"type": "function", "function": schema} for schema in function_schema]

## Post #352 by 23f2002205 (Post ID: 595182)
i think you have to run the following command


uv run datagen.py <your_email> --root ./data



try to include --root ./data in your code

Hello,

just a silly question, if my code runs well in docker environment with 
/data
 in root directory, will it be fine ?

or should i keep the relative 
./data
 directory like in the lecture ?

Thanks

---

## Post #355 by carlton (Post ID: 595189)
The reason in the lecture they were using ./data was because they were debugging in their local machine not in the docker.


For the docker image (the official submission) you must use /data.

It is a clear requirement mentioned in the project page.


Thats why it works fine when you use it in the docker image.


Kind regards

**Image Description:** The image is a screenshot of a form or quiz-like interface.  It contains two questions about a software project, likely related to development or deployment.

**Question 1:**
*   Asks for the GitHub repository link containing the code for "Project 1".
*   Provides an example format: `https://github.com/user-name/repository-name`.
*   The user has provided `https://github.com/Atimanas-Biswal421/proj1` as the answer.

**Question 2:**
*   Asks for the name of the image published on DockerHub.
*   Provides an example format: `user-name/image-name`.
*   The user has provided `atimanasbiswal/proj1-tds:final`.
*   An error message "Must match pattern" is displayed next to the user's answer. This suggests that the provided answer does not conform to the expected format of a DockerHub image name, probably due to the colon (:) in the answer.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a computer screen displaying what appears to be a coding environment or text editor. It's likely a software development or data analysis session, focused on a project involving credit card data.

**Key Elements:**

*   **Code Editor/IDE:** The screen is dominated by a coding environment, probably an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). The tabbed interface at the top suggests multiple files are open.
*   **Files and Project Structure:** On the left, there is a file explorer. The file names listed suggest a project focused on data manipulation or analysis. "credit\_card.png" and "credit\_card.txt" imply work on credit card information. Other files like "contacts.json", "email-sender.txt" could suggest integration with other systems.
*   **Main Panel:** The central area is filled with what appears to be code and debugging outputs.
*   **Terminal:** The bottom of the screen shows a terminal interface with the output of the program. It seems to be showing some test results.

**Specific Textual Information:**

*   **File Names:**
    *   "taskA2.py", "evaluate.py", and "datagen.py": Indicate Python scripts.
    *   "credit\_card.png" and "credit\_card.txt": Focus on processing of credit card data.
*   **Data:**
    *   "390 6622 2036 7260" appears to be a credit card number or part of one.
*   **Terminal Output:**
    *   "/data/credit-card.txt": Specifies the location of a file being processed.
    *   "EXPECTED: 4390652220367260078" and "RESULT: 43906522203672600": Indicate test data comparison.
    *   "HTTP Request": Likely part of the API call related to credit card.
    *   "All Failed" / "Failed data": Messages indicate failures in a test.

**Possible Questions and Context:**

*   What is the purpose of the "credit\_card" related files?
*   What programming language is being used? (Likely Python, based on the `.py` file extension.)
*   What is the nature of the "testing" or "evaluation" being shown?
*   Is this a debugging session? (The "PROBLEMS" tab and error messages suggest so.)
*   Are there security implications? (The handling of credit card data necessitates caution).
*   Is the project attempting to validate credit card numbers or process them?

**In summary,** the image presents a screen capture of a software development environment. The current focus seems to be on processing or validating credit card data. The presence of error messages and test results suggest that code development or debugging is taking place.

**Image Description:** The image shows a network request response, likely from a debugging tool or API client. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Status:** The status is "500 Internal Server Error", indicating a server-side issue.
*   **Response Details:** The image presents the "Response" tab, showing the raw response body.
    *   It's a JSON object.
    *   The content includes a "detail" field.
    *   The "detail" field holds error information, revealing that the HTTP status is actually a 401 "Unauthorized" error.
    *   The error is "Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer."
    *   The error also has a `type` field set to `invalid_request_error` and code `invalid_issuer`.
*   **Other Information:**
    *   Size: 184 Bytes.
    *   Time: 792 ms (response time).
    *   There are other tabs available, "Headers," "Cookies," "Results," and "Docs," but these aren't displayed.

**In summary:** The image demonstrates an HTTP 500 error that is the result of an authentication error (401 Unauthorized). The server is rejecting a token because it's not from a valid issuer.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Structure:**

*   The image shows a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) object.

**Content within the JSON Object:**

*   The primary element within the JSON object is a key-value pair where the key is `"message"`.
*   The value associated with `"message"` is a string:  `"On 2025-02 you used $2.0037491399999996, exceeding $2"`.

**Breakdown of the String Value:**

*   The message indicates some kind of usage or transaction on the date "2025-02."
*   It specifies that the user spent $2.0037491399999996, a value slightly over $2.00.
*   The message states that the spending amount "exceeds $2," suggesting a potential limit or warning.

**In summary:** The image presents a JSON message providing information about spending exceeding a set amount, indicating a date (February 2025), the exact amount spent, and the fact that it was over the limit.

## Post #374 by Jaideep (Post ID: 595295)
it usually happens in some GNU/Linux OS. since you are using some distribution based on Debian namely Ubuntu or whatever try doing sudo apt install python-packagename (replace package name with fastapi for fastapi)

then it works. It usually happens due to manual intervention with pip3 the user might break some system dependencies which require some python3 package. No need to worry about it.

Another Fix: try using a virtual environment which is highly suggested since there is no chance for you to interfere with the system packages.

create a venv using python3 -m venv name_of_venv

add this line to your .bashrc in ~ folder as source /path/to/your/venv/location

and run source .bashrc. This time no error occurs as you do everything in your virtual environment you can install anything python3 package using pip3 install package name.

It even happened for me

**Image Description:** The image shows a terminal session with a series of commands and their outputs. Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Initial Command and Error:**
    *   The user, identified as `jaideep@archlinux`, attempts to install the `numpy` package using `pip3 install numpy`.
    *   The output immediately shows an error message: "error: externally-managed-environment".

2.  **Explanation of the Error:**
    *   The output provides details about what this error means, explaining that the Python environment is managed by the system.
    *   It suggests using the `pacman` package manager to install packages system-wide.

3.  **Alternative Installation Methods:**
    *   The output offers options for installing non-Arch-packaged Python packages using a virtual environment:
        *   "python -m venv path/to/venv"
        *   Using the virtual environment's Python interpreter (`path/to/venv/bin/python`) and pip (`path/to/venv/bin/pip`).
    *   It also recommends using `pipx install xyz` to install applications in virtual environments.

4.  **Disclaimer and Warning:**
    *   A note indicates that if this error is unexpected, the user should contact their Python or OS provider.
    *   It explains that the user can bypass the error with `--break-system-packages` but warns of potential problems.

5.  **Hint:**
    *   The output provides a hint, referencing PEP 668 for a more detailed specification.

6.  **Activation of a Python Virtual Environment:**
    *   The next command activates a virtual environment located at `/home/jaideep/python3/bin/activate`. This suggests the user wants to install `numpy` into a virtual environment.

7.  **Reattempting Installation:**
    *   The user, still in the activated virtual environment, retries `pip3 install numpy`.

8.  **Success and Version Confirmation:**
    *   The output confirms that "Requirement already satisfied: numpy in ./python3/lib/python3.13/site-packages (2.2.2)". This means that `numpy` is already installed and the version installed is 2.2.2.

9. **Final prompt**
    *   The terminal prompt is shown again, confirming that user is active in the virtual environment.

In short, the image demonstrates a user encountering an "externally-managed-environment" error when trying to install a Python package with pip. The terminal session gives the user instructions on how to proceed, including system-wide installation advice, instructions on using virtual environments and ultimately the command for numpy installation and its confirmation.

Everytime I run datagen.py for the A1 task, the data file gets downloaded in the C drive instead of the current project folder. I even tried to set the current project folder as the root directory but it still downloads the files in C drive and I cant seem to find a workaround this. Can someone please help with this issue. Thanks!

## Post #395 by Kabir1203 (Post ID: 595366)
Can you please make the changes in the datagen.py file


config = {“root”: “/data”}


This is where I have been facing the issue.


The only solution I can think of is moving the /data folder from the root to the project directory. which I am not sure is a good way to solve this issue.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:** The image appears to be a screenshot from a Google Meet video call. The background is entirely black, and the focus is on a user's profile image.

**Key Elements:**

*   **Profile Image:**
    *   A large, solid orange circle is centered in the frame.
    *   A white letter "T" is centrally placed within the orange circle. This likely represents the first initial of the user.
*   **Google Meet Indicator:** In the top right corner, the Google Meet logo is visible, confirming the context of the image as a video call application.
*   **User Name:** At the bottom left corner, the text "TELVIN VARGHESE" is present. This is presumably the name of the user whose profile image is shown.
*   **Background:** The backdrop is a solid black color, common in video conferencing environments when a user's camera is off or when they are presenting content.

**In Summary:** The image showcases a Google Meet interface, focusing on a user named Telvin Varghese, who has their camera off or is in a presentation mode, displaying only their initial "T" as a profile picture within an orange circle.

 sir  do i have to put env file in docker

## Post #400 by 22f3002248 (Post ID: 595380)
you have to give the 
AIPROXY_TOKEN
 to the evaluate.py by either

bash - 
export AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token"

or

powershell - 
$env:AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token"

the evaluate.py file takes the token to send request to embedding end point for processing.

so you have to set 
AIPROXY_TOKEN
 in both terminals

i.e. app.py and evaluate.py teminals

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Structure:**
The image shows a terminal window with a black background. Text and command output are displayed in a monospaced font. The primary focus is a command execution and its results.

**Command Execution:**
*   The command used is `curl` to make a POST request to an API endpoint located at "http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings".
*   It's making a request related to text embeddings.
*   The command includes a header specifying "Content-Type: application/json".
*   The request body contains parameters: "model" is set to "text-embedding-3-small" and "input" is a list containing the words "king" and "queen".
*   The output shows the progress and result of this API call.

**Output Details:**
*   The output displays network transfer information such as percentage of completion (% Total, % Received, % Xferd), transfer speeds, and timing metrics (Time Total, Time Spent, Time Left, Current Speed).
*   The key output is a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) structure.
*   The JSON contains:
    *   An "object" field set to "list"
    *   A "data" field, containing an array with:
        *   An object with "object" as "embedding" and "index" set to 0.
        *   An "embedding" field containing a list of floating-point numbers, likely representing a vector embedding of the input text.

**Other Elements:**
*   The user is logged into a system, potentially using a shell like bash (`/usr/bin/bash --login-i`).
*   There is an environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN` which is a long string, probably a token for authentication.
*   The current directory seems to be "TDS-Project-1-LLM" based on the shell prompts.

**In Summary:** This image captures the process of calling a text embedding API and provides the vector representations for the provided input ("king" and "queen").

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/d/bd8b1f78ee2e9e130956f545a8e96d89d6785b2e.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a PowerShell 7 (x64) terminal window. It appears that a `curl` command is being executed to make a POST request to an API endpoint.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Command:** The command is `curl`. The `-X POST` indicates a POST request.
*   **URL:** The URL being targeted is `http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`. This likely points to an API endpoint for generating text embeddings.
*   **Headers:**
    *   `-H "Content-Type: application/json"` sets the content type of the request to JSON.
    *   `-H "Authorization: Bearer $AIPROXY_TOKEN"` includes an authorization header, likely with a token used for authentication. The `$AIPROXY_TOKEN` suggests the use of an environment variable for the token.
*   **Data (Body):** `-d '{"model": "text-embedding-3-small", "input": ["king", "queen"]}'` This is the JSON payload sent with the POST request. It specifies the model to use (`text-embedding-3-small`) and the input text ("king" and "queen") to be embedded.
*   **Output:** The terminal output includes the following:
    *   ">> \>\>" These lines are probably part of the shell's prompt or command completion.
    *   `{ "message": "Missing Authorization: Bearer header. See https://github.com/sanand0/ai proxy" }` is the server's response, which indicates an error: the authorization header is missing or incorrect. It also points to a GitHub repository for more information, which provides a hint for troubleshooting.
*   **User and location:** The user is "Nelson", and their current directory is `C:\Users\Nelson`.

In essence, the user is attempting to use an API to create text embeddings but has encountered an authorization error. The error message suggests checking the authorization headers and also the specified github address for troubleshooting and solutions.

**Image Description:** The image displays the output of a data generation process, likely in a web browser. Here's a breakdown:

**1. Browser Interface:**

*   The image showcases a web browser window.
*   The address bar at the top displays the URL: `127.0.0.1:8000/run?task=Install%20`. This indicates that the user is running a local web application, likely on port 8000, and has requested a task labeled "Install". The `%20` represents a space.

**2. Content (JSON Output):**

*   The main content is a block of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data, which is commonly used for data interchange.
*   The JSON structure begins with an opening curly brace `{` and ends with a closing curly brace `}`.
*   It contains two main key-value pairs:
    *   **"files":** This key holds an array of strings, each representing the name of a file that was generated. The list includes:
        *   "comments.txt"
        *   "contacts.json"
        *   "credit\_card.png"
        *   "dates.txt"
        *   "docs" (likely a directory)
        *   "email.txt"
        *   "format.md"
        *   "logs" (likely a directory)
        *   "ticket-sales-gold.txt"
        *   "ticket-sales.db"
    *   **"message":** This key's value is the string "Data generation complete". This is a confirmation message.

**3. Other elements:**

*   There's a checkbox labeled "Pretty-print" suggesting an option to display the JSON in a more readable format.
*   There are forward and back arrows typical of web browsers.

In essence, the image depicts the successful outcome of a data generation process, listing the generated files and confirming the operation's completion. The URL suggests the user is interacting with a web application that's responsible for this task.

Even the markdown file shows the correct email. What are the possible issues that I could be facing with this one.

### Image Insight:
![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/f/ffcb4192d3b1be3bc881e54720f2baa8d1b8a51e.png)

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall:**

The image shows a code editor interface. It appears to be a text editor like VS Code or similar, with syntax highlighting and a dark theme.  It seems focused on working with code and potentially markdown documents.

**File Structure / Tabs:**

*   There are several tabs visible at the top, suggesting multiple files are open: `.env`, `app.py`, `evaluate.py`, and `format.md`. The `format.md` tab is highlighted, indicating it's the currently active file.

**Content of `format.md`:**

*   The primary content of the editor window is text likely representing a Markdown file named `format.md`.
*   Line 1: `#Unformatted Markdown` - This is a heading in markdown.
*   Line 3: `This is a sample paragraph with extra spaces and trailing whitespace.`  - A sample paragraph to illustrate.
*   Lines 4-7: Markdown list items:
    *   `First item` (with a dash preceding it)
    *   `Second item` (with a dash preceding it)
    *   `+Third item` (with a plus sign preceding it)
    *   `Fourth item` (with an asterisk preceding it)
*   Lines 9-10: Python code:
    *   `py` (on its own line - potentially as a placeholder/snippet or a typo)
    *   `print("user@example.com")` - A Python print statement, likely intended to output an email address. The string `user@example.com` is highlighted in a color that suggests it is a string literal.

**Other Interface Elements:**

*   A "data >" element, suggesting a hierarchical file structure (it may be file explorer or project section).
*   There's a close button "X" on the `format.md` tab.
*   The bottom part of the editor window has a standard line-numbering.

**Overall Impression:**

The image portrays a development environment, likely for editing and formatting text, markdown, and potentially some code in python. The focus appears to be on how markdown is rendered/edited and possibly how to format some markdown content.

Respected Sir,

I sincerely request you to kindly consider granting a one-day extension for Project 1. Many key clarifications were provided in today’s session, and we need just one additional day to effectively implement them. This extension would be immensely helpful in ensuring a more refined submission.

I truly appreciate your time and consideration.

Thank you.

hey I have a few doubts, if something was said about this please say so.




in Phase be tasks do we have to store the output in files or just return it in the response


When I call my some of my endpoints using post man or CURL they work but if I run the evaluate.py it throws an error, this I think is a bug in the eval.py file.




any idea about these ?

**Image Description:** The image shows a form with two questions and associated answer fields. 

The first question is: "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 1? *". It also provides an example of how the answer should look: "It should look like https://github.com/user-name/repository-name". The provided answer is "https://github.com/rsjay1976/TDS-Project1-Ja".

The second question is: "What is the name of the image published on DockerHub? *". It provides an example: "It should look like user-name/image-name". The provided answer is "rsjay1976/tds-project1-Jan25".  Below this answer, there is an error message: "Must match pattern". This indicates that the entered answer doesn't conform to the expected format.

**Image Description:** The image shows an error message from a Python script related to using the OpenAI API. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Error Type:** `openai.OpenAIError` is raised, indicating an error originating from the OpenAI library.
*   **Error Description:** The message states that the `api_key` client option is missing. It explains that the API key must be provided in one of two ways:
    *   Passing the `api_key` parameter directly to the `OpenAI` client when it is initialized.
    *   Setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
*   **File and Line Numbers (for context):**
    *   The error occurs in `/app/app.py` on line 35 within a `<module>`. This suggests the error is in the main Python script.
    *   The error is also traced back to `openai/_client.py` line 110, which is part of the OpenAI library's implementation. This indicates that an attempt to initialize the OpenAI client failed due to a missing API key.

In essence, the screenshot illustrates a common issue when using the OpenAI API: a missing or improperly configured API key. The user needs to either provide the API key directly when creating the `OpenAI` client object or set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before running the script.

**Image Description:** The image is a terminal output from a Docker build process. Here's a breakdown:

**1. Docker Login and Build Command:**
   - The terminal starts with a Docker login command, which was successful.
   - It then executes a `docker build` command to build an image tagged as `pratik007thala/automation-agent`.

**2. Build Stages:**
   - The output indicates a build process with 3 stages.
   -  The build definition is loaded from a Dockerfile.
   -  The output shows "FINISHED" after building the image.

**3. Build Steps & Errors:**
   - The output shows the progression of steps, with "3.0s" marked in red indicating an error for "load metadata for docker.io/library/python:3.12-slim-bookworm".
   - Then an attempt to "pull token for registry-1.docker.io" which is successful.
   - Then the error occurs again.

**4. Dockerfile Snippet:**
   - A snippet of a Dockerfile is shown with:
       - `FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm` as the base image.
       - `Install essential system dependencies` is commented.

**5. Error Details:**
   - The core of the issue is detailed in the "ERROR" section.
   - "failed to resolve source metadata for docker.io/library/python:3.12-slim-bookworm" is the immediate problem.
   -  It subsequently reports a failure to copy:  `httpReadSeeker: failed open: failed to do request` when attempting to retrieve metadata from a cloudflare storage URL. This may suggest network issues, proxy problems, or the inability to connect to the Docker registry.
   -  The error includes a URL with Amazon S3-style parameters.

**6. Additional Information:**
   - The output mentions the Docker desktop, suggesting this is run on a desktop.
   - Also, `View build details: docker-desktop://dashboard/build/desktop-linux/desktop-linux/dhxc8xfhzd1m71ur9lgrwf9wn` provides the means to get more debugging info.

**In summary:** The Docker build is failing due to a problem retrieving the base image "python:3.12-slim-bookworm," likely stemming from network issues or inability to access the Docker registry. The error message indicates an issue with either connectivity or permissions with the cloudflare storage used to host the image.

**Image Description:** The image shows a file explorer, likely within an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like VS Code or PyCharm. The file structure belongs to a project named "TDS-Project-1" and also contains sub-projects with similar names. The structure is organized into folders and files, indicating a software development project, likely Python.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Project Root:** "TDS-Project-1" appears to be the top-level project folder. The icon next to it suggests it is the active project.

*   **Subdirectories:**
    *   `__pycache__`: Likely holds cached compiled Python bytecode files.
    *   `.venv`: A virtual environment folder for managing project dependencies,
    *   `tds-project-1`: Another sub-project.
    *   `app`: Possibly the application folder.
    *   `data`: Likely for data-related files.

*   **Files:**
    *   `_init_.py`: This file is common in Python projects. It's used to initialize a Python package.
    *   `funtion_tasks.py`: Likely contains task-related functions.
    *   `main.py`: This is the primary entry point of the application.
    *   `task_to_embed.txt`: Potentially holds the tasks to embed.
    *   `.gitignore`: Used to specify files or directories that should be ignored by Git (version control).
    *   `datagen.py`:  A Python file likely for data generation. Alongside this is "2, U". The "2" likely refers to the file's line number or a status and the "U" might refer to an uncommitted file.
    *   `Dockerfile`: Instructions for building a Docker image.
    *   `evaluate.py`: likely related to model evaluation, also has the labels "3, U", similarly.
    *   `README.md`: A Markdown file, most likely containing project documentation.
    *   `LICENSE`: A file with the project's licensing information.

*   **File Types:** The Python files (`.py`) are indicated by the Python icon, the text file has a document icon, the Dockerfile has a Docker icon, and the markdown files have a document icon.

*   **Colors:** The dark background and color-coded icons are typical of IDEs. The colors are used to distinguish different file types.

In summary, this is a well-organized Python project, possibly for a data science or machine learning task.  The presence of Dockerfile suggests the project is designed to be containerized, which is a common practice for reproducibility and deployment.

It will become public after you push to github.


While running evaluation script after submission your token might run out of credits.

**Image Description:** The image displays a response from an API or web service, likely in JSON format. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Interface:** The interface resembles a developer tool like Postman or a browser's developer console. There are tabs for "Response," "Headers," "Cookies," "Results," and "Docs."
*   **Response Section:** The "Response" tab is highlighted, indicating the active content being displayed is the server's response to a request.
*   **JSON Data:** The primary content is a JSON object, as indicated by the curly braces `{}`.
*   **Error Details:** The response contains an error message.
    *   `"detail": "Error code: 401 - { 'error': { 'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer' } }"`: This line provides the core error information.
        *   **Error Code:**  401 which commonly means "Unauthorized".
        *   **Message:** The message clearly states the problem: the authentication token provided is not valid. It is likely issued by an invalid issuer.
        *   **Type:** The error type is described as 'invalid\_request\_error'.
        *   **Parameter:** The 'param' parameter is set to 'None'.
        *   **Code:** The error code is 'invalid\_issuer'.
*   **Other Features:**
    *   A "Copy" button is present, suggesting the ability to copy the response data.
    *   There are icons in the top-right corner that likely represent options or further controls.

In summary, the image depicts an error response from an API. It indicates that the client's authentication attempt has failed because the provided token is not recognized as valid.

**Image Description:** Here is a detailed description of the image:

**Overall:**

The image is a medium shot featuring a young man standing in front of a wall covered with green vines. The man is the central focus.

**The Man:**

*   **Appearance:** He appears to be in his late teens or early twenties. He has dark hair, a light complexion, and is smiling slightly.
*   **Clothing:** He is wearing a light beige, long-sleeved shirt. The shirt has a mandarin collar and a series of small, dark buttons down the front. His sleeves are rolled up or pushed up slightly.
*   **Accessories:** He has a thin red bracelet on his left wrist and a black beaded bracelet on his right wrist.
*   **Pose:** He is standing and looking towards the camera. His hands are not fully visible, but his right hand is lightly touching his left.

**Background:**

*   **Vegetation:** The primary background element is a wall covered in lush green vines. The vines provide a natural, textured backdrop.
*   **Additional Elements:** To the left of the man, partially visible, is the corner of a building with a glass window/door frame. There is a hint of interior lighting in the background.
*   **Wall Decor:** A section of painted art with blue and green colours.

**Lighting and Composition:**

*   **Lighting:** The lighting appears to be natural, with soft shadows suggesting an overcast day.
*   **Composition:** The man is positioned in the center of the frame, with the background serving as a backdrop. The framing is close enough to clearly show the man's facial features and clothing details.

Hi ,


I am trying to build using both docker and podman but it failed on both. I have watched many videos trying to resolve this adn also chatgpt in order to resolve the issue but it seems to persist. I even uninstalled and reinstalled both podman and doceker multiple times but no help.


When i run command docker build -t ___________ .


the error that comes is :


Dockerfile:2


1 |     # Use a lightweight Python image

2 | >>> FROM python:3.12-slim

3 |

4 |     # Set the working directory in the container

Even tried getting python:3.12-slim separatly and trying again but that also didn’t work.

I think there is some problem in getting python:3.12-slim as the build always stops at this.


on asking ChatGPT it shows that some DNS or network issue is there. I even tried all the remedy that was provided on creating custom network etc. but this was also of no use


Kindly help me finding solution to this and pls mention any other assistance I may require to get this running


Thank You.

Aagman

@carlton
 needed a confirmation on this task


A8 * `/data/credit-card.png` contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt
 - in this task i assume prompt can ask for credit card number or other details like cvv and name.


My question is, whether my system should allow prompt that CVV or or such info ? or should give it ?

Previously I asked for some more credits to test my project. I got an email stating I have been provided with a new token but I think I got that same token again, not a new one. I still cant send request to the AIPROXY. Please help.






Do I need to submit the docker image name with the tag or without the tag? I submitted it before without the tag. Now i see that I have tagged the image with as v1 but I cant submit the form due to pattern matching problems. Should i submit again after tagging it with :latest ?

When I run my docker image using


podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME


Task A2 fails as the podman container is unable to find npx.


Running the same image using


docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME


works fine and Task A2 passes. I can’t understand why this is happening.


I also ran the image in both docker and podman in interactive mode as show in the below snippet from terminal.

When run using docker, 
which node
 gives 
/usr/bin/node
 as output but when run using podman, nothing.


shiva@shiva:~/Desktop/tdsp1$ sudo podman run --rm -it docker.io/myusername/myreponame /bin/sh

Most people are still prompting wrong.

I've found this framework, which was even shared by OpenAI President Greg Brockman.

Here’s how it works:

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be a close-up portrait of a man. The lighting suggests a well-lit, possibly outdoor environment, likely a sunny day, given the brightness of the image.

**Specific Features:**

*   **Subject:** The primary subject is a man.
*   **Facial Features:** The man has dark hair that is neatly styled, with some visible at the hairline. He is wearing glasses with a thin metal frame. He has a smile that reveals his teeth. The man has a light skin tone and appears to be of a young to middle-aged adult.
*   **Clothing:** He is wearing a dark-colored shirt, probably black.
*   **Background:** The background is slightly blurred, but tall buildings are discernible, indicating an urban environment or a high vantage point.
*   **Mood:** The image conveys a positive and friendly mood, primarily because of the man's smiling expression.
*   **Focus/Composition:** The focus is on the man's face. The composition places the man in the center of the frame.

**Potential Uses:**

*   This image could be used as a profile picture, a headshot for a professional setting, or as an illustration for an article or social media post.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/c/e/ce7a62f2fa1f33758771e9ef57dd90fe2d98b09d_2_502x500.jpeg)

**Image Description:** The image is a dark-themed infographic explaining the structure of a prompt for an AI (likely an LLM or Large Language Model). The title is "The Anatomy of an o1 Prompt." The image breaks down the prompt into four key sections, each marked with a colored vertical line to the right of the corresponding text:

1.  **Goal (Green line):** This section contains the core request. In this case, it's "I want a list of the best medium-length hikes within two hours of San Francisco. Each hike should provide a cool and unique adventure, and be lesser known."

2.  **Return Format (Blue line):** This part dictates how the AI should present its response. The example instructs the AI to provide the hike's name (as found on AllTrails), starting and ending addresses, distance, drive time, hike duration, and what makes the hike "a cool and unique adventure."

3.  **Warnings (Orange line):** This section includes constraints or precautions. Here, it warns the AI to "Return the top 3. Be careful to make sure that the name of trail is correct, that it actually exists, and that the time is correct."

4.  **Context Dump (Grey line):** This is a section containing extra information to help the AI understand the user's request. This provides background, preferences, and constraints, such as the fact that the users "hike a ton", have completed local SF hikes, have hiked Mount Tam recently and are looking for something different this time, and their shared interests like views, food, and uniqueness.

The image essentially outlines the structure of a well-crafted prompt, providing the user with the Goal, the specifications for the Return Format, any Warnings to consider, and Context to help get a better outcome.

sir I am noticing a pattern, that when I am running the datagen first. And then using the evaluate.py, then I am getting the A2 right.

But running the evaluation.py for the 2nd time cause the A2 to fail…

Probabbly Because the file in the data folder gets upated should I worry for that…

There has been an outage in some parts of the country related to cloudflare servers. What helped some students (and us) is using a completely different network eg. instead of using your home wifi, use mobile internet, since they go through a different DNS and this sometimes works.

We have not specified a size limit for the docker image, so in theory there is not a limit to the docker image size.

Hello  
@carlton
 Sir,

While running evaluate.py , I have observed that the expected  and actual output is having difference like “\n” then also it marks task as fail.


eg:


 EXPECTED:

Cover west give likely individual though question inside. System many human plant card among provide. Large former seek mouth there long.

Attention officer successful. Us population the true show.

Real cold if play side wind affect. Street cause investment receive have miss page station.

Cold rest term her conference. Animal sure campaign new.

Meeting back page exactly itself book forward. Decision western series under from shoulder. Pay during feeling newspaper human. Professional old recent beyond girl three human.

Difficult yourself build increase back put others.

Although artist operation thing skin lead. Billion deep measure down adult suggest. Anything action start artist when first.

Whole way know down. Music machine trip father rather.

Must medical bad law issue.

Someone explain seven maintain wrong day factor property.


 RESULT:

“Cover west give likely individual though question inside. System many human plant card among provide. Large former seek mouth there long.\nAttention officer successful. Us population the true show.\nReal cold if play side wind affect. Street cause investment receive have miss page station.\nCold rest term her conference.

 A5 FAILED


Will this be considered as failure in actual evaluation as well or will this be taken care in actual evaluation?

am I making any error when setting the directories?


Please help, have been facing this issue since the beginning of this project, initially tried to move the files from C drive to project folder but that does not seem like a viable solution.

**Image Description:** Here is a detailed description of the image:

The image is a screenshot of a web browser window. The browser is displaying the output of a command or script executed through a web interface.

**Key elements:**

*   **URL bar:** The browser's URL bar displays the address `127.0.0.1:8000/run?task=Install%20uv%20if%20required)%20and%20run%20https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-202...`. This URL suggests that a local server is running on port 8000, and it's running a script/command that installs something and executes it based on certain conditions. The text "Install" and  "run" are included in the URL, which means that this is likely to be an installation task.
*   **Content Section:** The primary content area of the browser displays a JSON response that is "pretty-printed".
*   **JSON Response:** The JSON structure provides an "success" message: `"Executed https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py with email trial@gmail.com"`. This indicates that a Python script named `datagen.py` was executed, likely from a GitHub repository. It suggests that the script was successfully run and had the email `trial@gmail.com` as an argument.

**Overall Interpretation:**

The image shows the successful execution of a script (`datagen.py`) from a GitHub repository within a web interface. The script seems to be part of a data science project based on the directory structure in the URL. The execution included an email address (`trial@gmail.com`), likely as a parameter.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/6/2/622e4a15020aefe140e92f8aa38035c5518ae41a_2_690x354.png)

**Image Description:** The image displays a Windows File Explorer window. The window is open in a folder named "data". The path shown in the address bar is "This PC > Acer (C:) > data". 

The left sidebar shows quick access folders and pinned folders such as "Pictures", "Desktop", "Downloads", "Documents", "Pictures", "Music", "Videos", "TDS assignments 4", and "llm-automation-agent".

The main content of the window lists files and folders within the "data" directory. The columns shown are: "Name", "Date modified", "Type", and "Size". Some files and folders listed are: "docs" (File folder), "logs" (File folder), "comments" (Text Source File, 10 KB), "contacts" (JSON Source File, 9 KB), "credit_card" (PNG File, 5 KB), "dates" (Text Source File, 15 KB), "email" (Text Source File, 1 KB), "format" (Markdown Source..., 1 KB), and "ticket-sales" (Data Base File, 32 KB). All of the files in the directory were last modified on 16-02-2025 at 11:58.

**Image Description:** The image displays a section of code, likely Python, with a dark theme. Here's a detailed breakdown:

**Code Structure and Purpose:**
*   The code appears to be setting up directory structures for a project. The goal is to access files from a specific data folder.
*   It's setting up a `PROJECT_ROOT` and `DATA_DIR`.
*   The `os.makedirs` call with `exist_ok=True` suggests it is creating a directory if it doesn't exist, without throwing an error if the directory already exists.

**Key Lines and Code:**
*   **Line 35:** `# Ensure all files are accessed from the 'data' folder inside the project root` - This is a comment, indicating the purpose of the code that follows.
*   **Line 36:** `PROJECT_ROOT = os.path.abspath(os.getcwd())` -  This line gets the current working directory (`os.getcwd()`) and converts it to an absolute path (`os.path.abspath()`). This sets the `PROJECT_ROOT`.
*   **Line 37:** `DATA_DIR = os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, "data")` - This constructs the path to the data directory (`DATA_DIR`) by joining the `PROJECT_ROOT` with the string "data".
*   **Line 39:** `# Ensure the 'data' directory exists` - This is a comment about ensuring the data directory.
*   **Line 40:** `os.makedirs(DATA_DIR, exist_ok=True)` - This uses `os.makedirs` to create the directory specified by `DATA_DIR` (which would be the "data" folder). The `exist_ok=True` argument is included to avoid errors if the directory already exists.

**Color-Coding:**
*   Comments are in green.
*   Keywords like "os" are possibly highlighted for emphasis.
*   Strings (like "data") are in a different color, possibly yellow or orange, indicating a string literal.

**Overall Impression:**
The code is concise and intended for setting up the directory structure for a project in Python. It focuses on creating the `DATA_DIR` inside the `PROJECT_ROOT` and ensures that the data folder will exist before any files are stored there.

I am also running datagen.py in the project directory, yet data folder is created in C drive.

### Image Insight:
![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/2/1/213611a3e30fbaa75a62a4a99c19b20458a92609.png)

**Image Description:** The image presents a Python script that defines a function called `run_datagen`.  This function appears to take a `task_description` as input and performs several operations. Let's break down the script's functionality:

1.  **Extract URL and Email:**
    *   It uses regular expressions (`re.search`) to find a URL and an email address within the `task_description`.
    *   The regular expressions are specified to match a URL ending in `.py` and an email address.

2.  **Error Handling:**
    *   It checks if either the URL or email was found. If not, it returns an error message.

3.  **Prepare Script Download:**
    *   Extracts the URL and the email found using `group(0)` to get the match.
    *   Defines a `script_path` based on the `PROJECT_ROOT` path (likely a constant variable) and the name "datagen.py".

4.  **Download Script:**
    *   It attempts to download a script from the extracted URL using the `requests` library.
    *   `response.raise_for_status()` checks if the download was successful. If not, it will raise an HTTP error.
    *   If the download is successful, it opens the `script_path` for writing in binary write mode (`"wb"`) and writes the content of the downloaded script to this file.

5.  **UV Installation Check:**
    *   It checks if `uv` is installed by running `uv --version`.
    *   If `uv` is not installed (caught by `FileNotFoundError`), it uses `pip install uv` to install it.

6.  **Script Execution:**
    *   It runs the downloaded script using `subprocess.run()`, passing the "python" command along with the script path and the user's email address.
    *   It sets the current working directory (`cwd`) to `PROJECT_ROOT`.
    *   The script executes with the user email as an argument.

7.  **Return Success:**
    *   If all operations succeed, it returns a success message, indicating that the script was executed along with the script URL and the user's email.

In short, this script downloads a Python script from a specified URL (presumably from the `task_description`), checks for and installs UV, and then runs the downloaded script with the user's email address as an argument. The script uses techniques such as regular expressions, file handling, and subprocess execution to accomplish its tasks.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Structure:**

The image is a black background with white text, resembling a log or terminal output. It seems to be displaying information about HTTP requests and their responses.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

*   **Lines of Text:**
    *   The image contains multiple lines of text, each starting with "INFO:" followed by an IP address and port number (e.g., "127.0.0.1:51794").
    *   These lines describe HTTP requests being made and the server's responses. The text after the port number details the request method (POST or GET), the URL path, and the HTTP version.
    *   Two example lines are:
        *   `INFO: 127.0.0.1:51794 - "POST /run?task=The+SQLite+database+file+%60%2Fdata%2Fticket-sales.db%60+has+a+%60tickets%60+with+columns+%60type%60 C+%60units%60%2C+and+%60price%60.+Each+row+is+a+customer+bid+for+a+concert+ticket.+What+is+the+total+sales+of+all+the+items+in+the+%22Gold%22+t ket+type%3F+Write+the+number+in+%60%2Fdata%2Fticket-sales-gold.txt%60 HTTP/1.1" 400 Bad Request`
        *   `INFO: 127.0.0.1:51797 - "GET /read?path=/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found`
    *   The quotes enclose a detailed description of what appears to be the HTTP request being made. The text includes URL-encoded characters (e.g., `%60`, `%2F`), suggesting the request is trying to perform actions related to a SQLite database and potentially a file named `ticket-sales-gold.txt`.
    *   The text after the HTTP version is the HTTP response code, which indicates the status of the request. The first example is "400 Bad Request" and the second is "404 Not Found," both indicating errors.

**Key Elements and Clues:**

*   **IP Addresses:** The lines all start with `127.0.0.1`, which is the loopback address (often meaning the requests are originating from the same machine).
*   **HTTP Request Methods:** The log shows "POST" and "GET" requests, common HTTP methods.
*   **URLs:** The URLs/paths reveal interesting information:
    *   `/run` is likely a part of the application used.
    *   `/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt` suggests a file or path containing some kind of data, likely related to "ticket sales."
*   **Error Codes:** The `400 Bad Request` indicates the server couldn't process the request, and the `404 Not Found` indicates the requested resource was not found.
*   **Keywords:** "SQLite," "database," "ticket-sales," "Gold", and "concert" provide context.

**Overall Impression:**

The image presents a log of interactions between a client and a server, likely related to processing ticket sales data, potentially from a SQLite database. The errors indicate that the requests are not being processed correctly, either because of the requests themselves or because the requested file wasn't found. It looks like an attempt to manipulate a database or access files is being made.

I am getting this error when I try to run evaluate.py


when I run the evaluate.py by having datagen.py in same folder , it is running perfectly. But my doubt is only after task a1 runs the datagen.py will be downloaded into the /data folder right ?

Kindly help me with this issue

Use following as first parameter of 
subprocess.run()
 to create 
data/
 directory inside your project instead of C: drive


["uv", "run", script_url, user_email, "--root", "./data"]



Also, you don’t need to download to script, you can directly run it from the url.

---

## Post #519 by Aditya_Sahu (Post ID: 595863)
The reason for error is 
evaluate.py
 is trying to import 
datagen.py
 which doesn’t exist in your system. I’ll suggest download both the files, keep them in same folder and run 
evaluate.py
 from your computer

---

## Post #520 by 23f3002091 (Post ID: 595864)
Yes actually Thats my doubt , when I run both in same folder it is working , but only after task a1 runs datagen.py will be downloaded in /data folder  right ?,


or did I misunderstood something??

Currently, it can complete 7 out of 10 tasks. In reality, it can complete 9 out of 10 tasks, but the expected results are not flexible in evaluate.py file.


If we can extract credit card numbers, it will be able to complete 10 out of 10 tasks.

sir for this task- A6 Find all Markdown (

 ) files in 
/data/docs/
 . For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with 
# 
 ). Create an index file 
/data/docs/index.json
 that maps each filename (without the 
/data/docs/
 prefix) to its title (e.g. 
{"README.md": "Home", "path/to/large-language-models.md": "Large Language Models", ...}
 )   …I am getting correct result for all files but for the very first file budget.md it shows wrong.

my result- { “budget.md”: “Success easy same main modern doctor.”,

“build.md”: “Shoulder follow own never above.”,

and in the data files there is different heading in budget.md.-  # Series dog who make specific agree between.

my question is this if it works for all the files then why not for this file budget.md

## Post #535 by Saransh_Saini (Post ID: 595917)
Check the file once, there is a possibility that it’s either fetching a comment or the second heading. Refactor your prompt to search only for the First Heading, specify it explixitly.

This is happening because evaluate.py is unable to fetch your API Key from the environment variables. Create a new variable and set it’s value to your API Key then try.

---

## Post #541 by Flibon (Post ID: 595959)
Hi everyone,


I’m running into an issue with the AI Proxy embeddings endpoint while executing the A9 task. Every time I send a POST request to:


bash


Copy


https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings



I receive a 
401 Unauthorized
 response. This, in turn, causes my code to fail with a 
KeyError: 'data'
 because the expected JSON response doesn’t include the 
"data"
 key.


What I’ve Tried




Token Verification:






I’m using the 
AIPROXY_TOKEN
 obtained by logging in at 
aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev
 with my IITM email.


The token is passed in the header as follows:




python


Copy


"Authorization": f"Bearer {AIPROXY_TOKEN}"





I added debug prints to confirm that the token is being used correctly (printing the first few characters).






API Request Details:






The request includes the correct 
Content-Type: application/json
 header.


The payload is set as:




json


Copy


{"model": "text-embedding-3-small", "input": ["Test"]}





Despite this, the response status is consistently 401 Unauthorized.






Debug Output:

Here’s a snippet of the debug output:




bash


Copy


HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized"
🔴 A9 failed: 'data'



This confirms that the issue is with the authentication rather than our processing logic.


What I Suspect




The token may be invalid, expired, or misconfigured.


There could be changes in the token permissions or endpoint requirements that I’m not aware of.


Alternatively, there might be an issue on the server side with token validation.




Request for Help


Has anyone else encountered this issue recently? Could someone verify if there are any changes to the authentication requirements for the embeddings endpoint? Any insights or updated instructions on how to ensure the token is valid and has the proper permissions would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks in advance for your assistance!

B5. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database

Should I ask for the SQL data base. Or the agent should be smart enough to find the required database…

Moreover in the data folder there is only one database is it should be robust to handle multiple databases…

## Post #544 by bhashwar_sengupta (Post ID: 595982)
I had a question on evaluation by the course team. To test that my application would run everywhere, I first deleted all images from my local machine using 
podman rmi -a
 and then ran 
podman run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN $IMAGE_NAME
 with the appropriate variables set. This is as per the instructions provided 
here
. But this gave me the following error:


Error: short-name "freshbash/dataworks-agent" did not resolve to an alias and no unqualified-search registries are defined in "/etc/containers/registries.conf



The above is the format in which we have to provide the image name in the Google form. So, I was confused whether this would succeed during actual evaluation.


The only way its working right now is when I specify the image name to be 
docker.io/freshbash/dataworks-agent


I’m not yet very good with how containers work so some insights would be very helpful. Thanks!

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/3/2/32b55ca09f5894f9baa7082d8a44fdb1d14268f0_2_690x211.png)

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Structure:**

The image presents information related to "Codespaces," likely a feature within a software development platform. The layout suggests a user interface displaying usage metrics, quotas, and potentially billing information. The design uses a dark theme with white or light gray text on a dark background.

**Key Elements & Content:**

1.  **Codespaces Header:**
    *   A box icon, which could be a logo or symbol representing "Codespaces" or a related feature.
    *   The text "Codespaces"  in bold.
    *   The phrase "Included quotas reset in 10 days."
    *   A link "See billing documentation".

2.  **Usage Hours Section:**
    *   Label "Usage hours" to the left.
    *   An arrow on the left.
    *   The metric displayed: "172.37 of 180.00 included core hours used". This suggests the user has used 172.37 out of a total of 180 core hours.
    *   A visual progress bar (red) representing usage.
    *   The number "$0.00" on the right which is most likely the cost.

3.  **Storage Section:**
    *   Label "Storage" to the left.
    *   An arrow on the left.
    *   The metric displayed: "9.21 of 20.00 included GB-month used."  This indicates the user has utilized 9.21 GB-month of storage out of a total of 20 GB-month.
    *   A visual progress bar (blue) representing usage.
    *   The number "$0.00" on the right which is most likely the cost.

4.  **Monthly Spending Limit:**
    *   The text "$0.00 monthly spending limit | Set up a spending limit".
    *   The text "$0.00" on the right which is most likely the cost.

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a snapshot of resource usage and cost associated with a "Codespaces" environment.  It highlights usage hours, storage consumption, and potential billing details. The interface likely provides monitoring and control over these aspects.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/b/9/b9a9d315d58f80e3b851da3a0e981365d48de980_2_690x149.png)

**Image Description:** The image is a section of a user interface, likely related to the management of a cloud-based development environment called "Codespaces". Here's a breakdown:

**Header:**

*   The top section displays the name "Codespaces" along with a small icon (likely representing the environment) to its left.
*   It mentions that "Included quotas reset in 13 days".
*   There's a link labeled "See billing documentation."

**Usage Information:**

*   **Usage Hours:**
    *   A section titled "Usage hours".
    *   Displays "120.00 of 120.00 included core hours used", indicating the user has reached their maximum quota.
    *   A red progress bar visually represents the complete utilization.
    *   The cost is listed as "$0.00".
*   **Storage:**
    *   A section titled "Storage".
    *   Shows "1.46 of 15.00 included GB-month used".
    *   A blue progress bar indicates storage usage.
    *   The cost is listed as "$0.00".

**General observations:**

*   The background is a dark blue or black, with white text for readability.
*   The interface uses icons to denote elements.
*   The design is modern, reflecting common UI trends in cloud services.
*   The image indicates that the user has fully utilized their included core hours, while also having room for storage.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:** The image appears to be a screenshot or a design for a project hosted on a platform like GitHub. The layout and the icons suggest this.

**Key Elements:**

*   **Project Name/Title:**
    *   `Tusharisme/` is written at the top in a dark gray, medium-bold font.
    *   `TDS_Project_1` is written below that in a bold, dark gray font. This is likely the name of the project.
*   **Icon:** A square icon is located to the right of the project name, with a light gray background. The icon contains blue squares in a grid pattern that seems to represent a stylized letter "W" or an abstract design.
*   **Statistics/Metadata:** Below the project name and to the left are a few statistics that likely describe the project's status on GitHub or a similar platform:
    *   `1` is written next to an icon representing a person and label "Contributor"
    *   `0` is written next to an icon representing an exclamation point and label "Issues"
    *   `0` is written next to an icon representing a star and label "Stars"
    *   `0` is written next to an icon representing a fork symbol and label "Forks"
*   **Platform Logo:** In the bottom-right corner, there is a logo resembling the GitHub logo. This reinforces the idea that the image relates to a project hosted on GitHub.
*   **Background:** There is a horizontal rectangular solid background on the bottom with the color of blue.

**In Summary:** The image is likely a project page from a platform like GitHub, showcasing the project name, its visual identifier, and a few metrics about its activity.

Hey I just got a mail saying that my github repo has no Dockerfile present. and im confused .


It doesnt mention anywhere that the dockerfile must be present in the root directory as a requirement/prerequisite of the project.


In my case its present inside the app directory. Could the team help clarify on this issue.

I got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‘dockerfile’. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm.


Shall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?

Dear

 , 
@carlton
 , 
@Jivraj
 , and 
@Saransh_Saini


Thank you all for this wonderful project. Coming from a non-coding background, I have learned a lot new things throughout this project building process.


@carlton
 Sir, yesterday’s session provided valuable insights into Method 1 (prompt engineering) for dynamically handling tasks. I was able to develop an application using this approach; however, due to submission time constraints, I could not verify all tasks (my bad). While I tested some tasks and found the results to be highly accurate, I was unable to validate everything thoroughly.

Therefore, I submitted the function-calling approach (Method 2) instead.


I sincerely appreciate everyone’s guidance and support.

this problem occuring sir since two days

### Image Insight:
![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/d/0/d084b074bcf4af69fe3e57753664fd39b016c2ef_2_690x365.png)

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Structure:**

The image is a screenshot of Visual Studio Code (VS Code) IDE, likely with a Python project open. It displays multiple panes, including a file explorer, code editor, terminal, and possibly a debug/output window. The color scheme is dark, typical of a modern IDE.

**File Explorer (Left Pane):**

*   **Root:** "ALGSOCH" which is likely the name of the project
*   **Directories:** A hierarchical structure, with folders like `app`, `data`, `tests`, etc.  The `app` folder has a `.py` file.
*   **Files:** Several Python files are listed, including `main.py`, `database.py`, `tasks.py`, `tempCodeRunnerfile.py`, `README.md`, `requirements.txt`.
*   **Other files:** `Dockerfile`, `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore`, `config.py`, and `LICENSE`.

**Code Editor (Center Pane):**

*   **File:** `main.py` is currently open in the editor.
*   **Code:** Python code is visible. The code imports `fastapi` and defines an API endpoint. Specifically, the code imports FastAPI and run\_task. There's a GET endpoint ("/") that returns a message, and a POST endpoint ("/run").
*   **Line Numbers:** The editor displays line numbers, making it easy to reference code.

**Terminal/Output Pane (Bottom Pane):**

*   **Content:** This is the most active part of the image. It shows the output of various commands.
    *   **`pip install --upgrade pip`:** Attempts to upgrade the pip package manager, which is part of the Python setup.
    *   **Error Messages:** Several error messages are displayed:
        *   "Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement python (from versions: none)": Suggests there's an issue with the Python version or dependencies.
        *   "No matching distribution found for python": Indicating a problem with finding the required Python package.
        *   "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'": This indicates that the `fastapi` library is not installed or not accessible in the current environment.
    *   **Docker Build:** There's a Docker build command: `docker build -t llm-agent`.  This is an attempt to build a Docker image, potentially for deploying the application. The output shows steps related to the build process.

**Other Elements:**

*   **Active file:** `main.py` is highlighted in the file explorer.
*   **Status Bar:**  The status bar at the bottom of the window displays information about the current environment (Python version), file type, line/column position, and other IDE-related settings.
*   **Debug and Run Buttons**: On the top right, the presence of the `run` button suggests that the code might be ready to run/debug.

**Key Observations/Possible Issues:**

*   **Dependency Problems:** The primary issue appears to be related to Python package management. The code is failing to import `fastapi`, and there are errors during `pip install` and the Docker build process.
*   **Python Environment:** It is possible the user has not activated the environment in which FastAPI is installled.
*   **Docker:** The Docker build process is starting, suggesting an attempt to containerize the application, which is also failing because of missing Python package(s).

**In summary:**  The image showcases a developer working on a Python project that uses FastAPI. The developer is encountering several issues related to package dependencies and is attempting to create a Docker container for the application.

How long does it take to make a docker image, I’ve been doing it for the past 25 minutes and it’s still not completed.

---

## Post #602 by lakshaygarg654 (Post ID: 596144)
Your LLM app should be designed like it can give desire result based on task desc at run endpoint, and that result should be accessible at read endpoint.






Evaluation file just for reference to check how things works and it works for phase A tasks only. Also ensure datagen.py file and evaluation.py file are latest. There is one issue in evaluation.py file for task A1,  link of datagen.py file not correct, rectify that link. Even it corrected in GitHub repo file but when I download that raw file in local system it takes back previous link.

@carlton

Dear Sir,


I am writing to you in a state of distress and humility. An unfortunate mistake on my part has led to the upload of an incorrect Docker image link. When I checked the authenticity of the link, it showed an error, even though the GitHub repository link is functioning perfectly.


I have poured my heart and soul into this project, dedicating countless hours and sleepless nights to ensure its success. The project has successfully passed both Test A and Test B, and I was thrilled to see my hard work paying off. However, this single error has left me devastated.


I am pleading with you, with all my heart, to allow me to correct this mistake by updating the Docker image link. Alternatively, I humbly request that my application be reviewed directly through GitHub. Please consider this an exception, as I have worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to create an application that is 890 lines long.


I beg for your understanding and leniency in this matter. This project means the world to me, and I am genuinely sobbing over this setback.


Thank you for considering my heartfelt request.


Sincerely,


Rishit Jain

## Post #619 by GIRISH_VISHVESHVAR_B (Post ID: 596203)
I don’t think the project is too difficult to implement—it’s essentially a simple HTTP API for an AI agent that reads a task, converts it into parameters, and passes those parameters to specific functions to complete the task. However, the instructions in the project question aren’t very clear. Before the session, I am unable to fully understand the question. It took me almost an entire day just to understand what we need to do.

Sir Could you provide test cases or a sample answer for Phase B?

 sorry to disturb you, project1 deadline is over.

I made a mistake in my project. In my call llm function i set some payload instead of default for open ai api call like max token, temp. , n, stop etc.

Due to this, some tasks may fail especially credit card image task will fail 100%, if possible can i just remove that payload from git hub repository . or you can check this call llm function present in my task_handler.py file of my repository.

I found this issue after deadline. If possible consider this request. I never engaged in a project or course like for this one. I love this project genuinely.

@TheVishal

EDIT: Create a new docker image with the mistaken image name , so when they pull image from repo, that image with the wrong name also gets pulled.

what to do




push a new image with the mistaken name, so in your repo there will be two images

how will this help?


since you are unsure, which image link you posted, you can be sure that even you had a mistake in link, a new image will exist with the wrong name after you push another image




@all

use this to update your image even after submission, as now they only validate the images, they do not pull it so you can edit your project and add more functionality if they release the code solutiion

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/b/9/b9a9d315d58f80e3b851da3a0e981365d48de980_2_690x149.png)

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Structure:**

*   The image appears to be a section of a dashboard or interface, likely related to a cloud-based development environment called "Codespaces". It's organized with sections for different resource usages and a heading.
*   The background is a dark navy blue, giving it a sleek and modern aesthetic.

**Key Elements & Text:**

1.  **Heading:**
    *   "Codespaces" - This is the main heading, indicating the subject of the data displayed.
    *   A graphic icon, a code symbol, next to "Codespaces"
    *   "Included quotas reset in 13 days. See billing documentation" - This provides important information about quota resets and links to billing details.

2.  **Usage Hours Section:**
    *   "Usage hours" - This labels the first usage category.
    *   "120.00 of 120.00 included core hours used" - This indicates that all core hours have been utilized.
    *   A red progress bar is shown, visually representing the full utilization of the included core hours.
    *   "$0.00" to the right, suggesting the service is currently at no cost.

3.  **Storage Section:**
    *   "Storage" - Labels the second usage category.
    *   "1.46 of 15.00 included GB-month used" - Shows the storage usage of the user, which is currently 1.46 GB of the 15 GB available.
    *   A progress bar, rendered in blue, reflects the current storage usage.
    *   "$0.00" to the right, implying there is no cost at this time.

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a clear and concise display of resource usage within "Codespaces". The information about core hours is particularly noticeable as the user has reached the limit. The clean design and use of progress bars make it easy to grasp the status of resource consumption.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/d/a/da23d8a478ff6a79db4af56fef947fd376297d82_2_690x103.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a message related to "codespaces" with several key elements:

*   **Title:** "Your codespaces" is displayed prominently at the top left.
*   **Buttons:** Two buttons are visible on the top right: "Go to docs" (dark background) and "New codespace" (green background).
*   **Warning Message:** A red-brown box highlights a warning. Inside this box:
    *   An exclamation point icon within a red octagon.
    *   Text that states "You're at 100% of your included usage for this billing period. For more information, view your billing settings."
    *   The words "billing settings" are blue and underlined, suggesting a clickable link.

The image conveys a message that the user has reached the limit of their codespace usage for the current billing period. It directs the user to billing settings for further information.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Structure:**

The image is a screenshot of a user interface, likely related to resource usage or billing for a service called "Codespaces". The interface has a dark blue/gray background with white text and some graphical elements. The information is organized into sections and utilizes progress bars to visualize resource consumption.

**Specific Elements and Text:**

*   **Codespaces:** This is the title or heading of the displayed section. It indicates that the content relates to the "Codespaces" service. There is an icon to the left, which resembles code symbols.
*   **"Included quotas reset in 8 days. See billing documentation":**  This line provides important information about quota resets and includes a link to the billing documentation.
*   **Usage hours:** This is a section heading.
    *   **"180.00 of 180.00 included core hours used":** This line indicates that the user has used 180.00 out of the 180.00 core hours included. This is represented by a red bar fully filled out.
    *   **$0.00:**  A cost related to "Usage hours", implying the usage is within the included quota, thus no extra cost is incurred.
*   **Storage:** This is another section heading.
    *   **"9.60 of 20.00 included GB-month used":** This shows storage usage, with 9.60 GB-month of the included 20.00 GB-month used. A blue progress bar is partially filled, visualizing the usage.
    *   **$0.00:** The cost associated to this storage usage, which could mean the user is within their quota.

**Visual Cues:**

*   **Progress Bars:** The image uses horizontal bars to represent the used resources. The length of the bar corresponds to the amount of resource consumed.
*   **Color Coding:**  Red is used for the "Usage hours" which seems to be completely consumed. Blue represents storage usage and is only partially filled.

**Potential Functionality:**

This interface likely provides information on the usage of a "Codespaces" service, possibly a cloud-based development environment. It allows users to monitor their resource consumption (core hours and storage) and see how close they are to exceeding their included quotas. The cost, when the resources are used within the included quota, is shown as $0.00.

 Is there something like peer-review in the project, I found this in the grading document.

**Image Description:** The image is text-based. It contains a single sentence that reads: "P1 and P2 will have two components - Submissions and peer reviews with weightage 80:20." The text is black and appears to be against a white background. It suggests a grading or evaluation scheme with two components: Submissions and peer reviews. The weightage of these components is mentioned as 80:20. "P1" and "P2" may refer to either participants or courses.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/0/8/08a834722986d3dccd4bf9fb24640bd842d76d08.png)

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Structure:**

*   The image appears to be a vertical block or section of a larger form. It has three distinct boxes or sections separated by horizontal lines.

**Text:**

*   **Top Box:** Contains the text "Peer Review Date".
*   **Middle Box:** Contains a single hyphen or dash (-).
*   **Bottom Box:** Contains the text "Tuesday, February 25, 2025".

**Objects and Features:**

*   The boxes are plain and rectangular.
*   The text is in a clear, readable font, likely a sans-serif font.
*   The organization suggests a form or template where information is to be filled in.

**Possible Interpretations:**

*   It is very likely a part of a form relating to the peer review process.
*   The "Peer Review Date" heading implies the form's purpose.
*   The "Tuesday, February 25, 2025" indicates a specific date, presumably the deadline or the date the form or review was completed.
*   The empty middle box with a dash suggests the reviewer has yet to input the date, or perhaps no date is needed.

This description should provide a thorough understanding of the image's contents.

This project is one of the best experiences I had in the entire degree program. I could say this without any hesitation that what I learnt in the past 10 days >> last 3 months.


I really appreciate the idea of open internet type of evaluations, wherein, you implement things without any constraints, learning for the sake of implementing.


Doing this project, I also found many new ideas wherein function calling can be used to solve new problems. I also learned many new things from enthusiastic peers like 
@23f1002382
 and also got the chance to help a few.


I thank the entire TDS team - 
@s.anand

**Image Description:** The image is a screenshot of a POST request made in an API testing tool like Postman or Insomnia. Here's a breakdown of what's visible:

**General Overview:**

*   **Interface:** The interface suggests a tool for making and inspecting HTTP requests. The layout with tabs for parameters, authorization, headers, body, scripts, tests, and settings is typical of API testing tools.
*   **Request Type:** The method is POST, indicated by the "POST" button on the left side.
*   **URL:** The target URL is `http://localhost:8000/run?task=The file /data/dates.txt co...`. This suggests a local server running on port 8000.
*   **Response:** The response section shows a "200 OK" status code, indicating a successful request. The details include the response time (1.83 seconds) and size (386 B).

**Request Details:**

*   **Params Tab:**  The "Params" tab is selected. The only parameter shown is "task" with the value "The file /data/dates.txt co...". This seems to be a file processing task.
*   **Headers:**  There is a "Headers (7)" tab, implying some header information exists.
*   **Body Tab:** The "Body" tab is selected. The body contains a JSON response.
*   **JSON Response:** The body contains a JSON response. The JSON response contains an error message and values. Specifically, it shows:

    *   `"error": { ... }` which shows `"message": "Invalid value: 'json'. Supported values are: 'json_object', 'json_schema', and 'text'."` This indicates that the service is expecting a different data format (e.g., `json_object` or `text`) for the request's body rather than simply `"json"`.
    *   `"type": "invalid_request_error"`.
    *   `"param": "response_format.type"`.
    *   `"code": "invalid_value"`.
    *   `"monthlyCost": 0.07081907999999999`.
    *   `"cost": 0`.

**Additional Information:**

*   **"Cookies" Button:** Suggests that cookies could be involved in the request.
*   **"Postbot" keyboard shortcut**: The text `Ctrl Alt P` appears in the bottom right, indicating the tool has a feature called "Postbot".

**In Summary:**
The screenshot is of a POST request made to a local server. The request seems to be attempting to process a file with the text "The file /data/dates.txt co...". The server is returning a 200 OK response, but with an error message stating the "json" format is not supported. Additionally, some cost and monthly data are present in the returned JSON. The user needs to modify the request (probably the `Content-Type` header or the format of the data in the body) to resolve the error.

                                "description": "Name of the python module"
                            }
                        },
                        "required": ["module"],
                        "additionalProperties": False
                    }
            }
        }
    }
}
}







It clearly says in your error message:


Invalid value: ‘json’


if you look at the “type” key in your response_format variable at the top,


the value cannot be “json”


The error is telling you what the supported values are


‘json_object’, ‘json_schema’, and ‘text’


Since you are defining a schema the correct value should be ‘json_schema’


So therefore you should change


"type": "json"



to


"type": "json_schema"



If you have trouble constructing Json schemas,

either feed it to gpt and have it correct it (along with your error) or please go over Module 3, in particular


https://tds.s-anand.net/#/llm-text-extraction


There is a clear example you can use as a template. We use the same one as a template when we do it in the sessions. That way you will make less errors.

No human peer reviews. The peer will be an LLM that has been given the rubrics and fine tuned.

I know this is a late reply, but its not possible for us to consider changes to your project after the deadline for academic integrity purposes.


If we were to allow it, we would have to allow everyone to make changes to their project as well for it to be fair.

Alright,

I just wanted to bring a small limitation in my project’s LLM function to your attention, which I discovered after submission. It may impact one or two tasks. However, no concerns—this has been a great learning experience.


And if possible, just add one line in your Evaluation LLM prompt: 
“Give loose marking for effort!”
—because, you know, creativity deserves some extra credit!

This docker image has outlived many students’ hopes, dreams and ambitions of passing this course.


Why is it still not being detected properly on the docker hub?

What in the April Fools is this 




It hasn’t even been morning yet!




PS ( 
@carlton
 
@Jivraj
 ): My P1 submission had passed all the basic sanity checks on 15th February. No breaking modifications to the Github repo nor the DockerHub image have been made since then. There’s something bugged in your scripts. Kindly check.

### Image Insight:
![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/1/9/19ee62dc5d7a4dc1f92c30889a34483fe266978d.png)

**Image Description:** The image displays a list of checks with their results, likely evaluating a project or assignment related to software development and DevOps. 

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Checks and Results:**
    *   "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: FAIL" - This indicates the project failed because a Docker image, accessible on Docker Hub, wasn't found or was not publicly accessible.
    *   "Is Github repo present AND public: PASS" - The GitHub repository was successfully found and is public.
    *   "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: PASS" - A Dockerfile exists in the root directory of the GitHub repository.
    *   "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: PASS" - An MIT license file is present in the root of the GitHub repository.
*   **Prerequisites and Scoring:**
    *   "Prerequisites: FAIL" - The prerequisites for the project failed. This is underlined indicating the reason for failure.
    *   "Project 1 Score: 0" - The score for Project 1 is 0, likely due to the "Prerequisites: FAIL" result.
*   **Other elements:**
    *   A red circle around the first line.
    *   The symbols ?? and dots are written on the right side of the image.

**In summary:** The image shows an evaluation of a project, with the primary failure being related to the Docker image availability in dockerhub and/or the project prerequisites. The GitHub repo and license-related checks passed.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/e/c/ec83ed7abc829b1bf89cfa30f9c84c1075717a63.png)

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

The image presents a table or list with information, likely related to some form of content repository or management interface.  Here's a breakdown:

*   **Table Headers:**
    *   "Last Pushed" - indicates the last time an item was updated or modified.
    *   "Contains" - likely describes the type of content, with all entries containing "IMAGE".
    *   "Visibility" - indicates the access level or privacy setting of the content.
*   **Data Rows:**
    *   **Row 1:**
        *   "Last Pushed": "about 2 hours ago"
        *   "Contains": "IMAGE"
        *   "Visibility": "Public" (circled in red)
    *   **Row 2:**
        *   "Last Pushed": "2 months ago"
        *   "Contains": "IMAGE"
        *   "Visibility": "Public"
*   **Annotations:** Red lines and circles highlight:
    *   The text "about 2 hours ago" with a red line.
    *   The text "Public" in the first row with a red circle.
*   **Overall Design:** The background is dark, with white text, suggesting a user interface or a data display. The consistent structure with headers and rows implies a structured data display format.

In summary, the image appears to be a screenshot of a display showing the "Last Pushed" dates and the visibility of some image content, with one entry being "Public".

**Image Description:** The image is a screenshot of a GitHub repository page named "TDS_Project_1". Here's a breakdown:

**Main Elements:**

*   **GitHub Interface:** The overall layout and styling clearly indicate a GitHub repository view. The top navigation bar features links for "Code," "Issues," "Pull requests," etc.
*   **Repository Name:** The repository name is "TDS\_Project\_1". The URL in the browser address bar confirms this: "github.com/231000879/TDS\_Project\_1"
*   **File Listing:** The primary content is a file and directory listing within the repository.  Files include:
    *   `.pycache__` (directory)
    *   `data` (directory)
    *   `Dockerfile`
    *   `LICENSE`
    *   `README.md`
    *   `app.py`
    *   `datagen.py`
    *   `evaluate.py`
    *   `tasksA.py`
    *   `tasksB.py`
*   **Commit History/Log:** The list of files/directories also shows a history of changes. For some files, it lists the number of changes made, the time passed and a short description of the change, for example, "completed," "Implemented API for automation agent".
*   **"About" Section:**  Located on the right side of the screen, it contains information like:
    *   No description, website, or topics provided.
    *   Readme
    *   MIT license
    *   Activity
    *   0 stars
    *   1 watching
    *   0 forks
    *   Release: No releases published.
    *   Packages: No packages published.
*   **Languages:** A section at the bottom lists the languages used in the project, including:
    *   Python: 98.1%
    *   Dockerfile: 1.9%

**Other Features:**

*   **Branch Information:** It shows the "main" branch is currently selected.
*   **"Code" Button:** A prominent green "Code" button suggests options to download the code.
*   **Screenshot Tool:** A "Snipping Tool" window is visible at the bottom, indicating a screenshot has been taken and copied to the clipboard. The message suggests that the screenshot has been saved to the screenshots folder.

**In summary:** The image presents a GitHub repository, likely for a Python-based project, showing the project structure, some file activity, and basic repository metadata.

*   **User and Hostname:** The prompt starts with "hsent@DESKTOP-89FBVHS", followed by "MINGW64" and "~ (main)". This indicates the user "hsent" on a machine named "DESKTOP-89FBVHS", and it is running under the MINGW64 environment, most likely on Windows. The "(main)" suggests a Git branch context.
*   **Commands and Output:**
    *   `$ cd hello_world`:  This is a `cd` (change directory) command, attempting to move into a directory named "hello\_world".
    *   `$ ^[[200~ls -1 Dockerfile`: This seems to be an attempt to execute a command, but likely the input was not properly entered.
    *   `bash: $'\E [200~1s': command not found`: This error indicates that the shell cannot interpret the command which failed.
    *   `$ ls -1 Dockerfile`: This `ls` (list) command, with the `-l` option for long listing, searches for a file named "Dockerfile".
    *   `-rw-r--r-- 1 hsent 197609 343 Feb 16 18:50 Dockerfile`: The output from `ls -l` shows detailed information about the "Dockerfile" file. It reveals its permissions (-rw-r--r--), number of hard links (1), owner (hsent), file size (197609), date and time of last modification (Feb 16 18:50), and filename (Dockerfile).
    *   `$ ^C`: This likely represents a Ctrl+C keypress, typically used to interrupt a running process or to cancel a command in the terminal.

*   **Context:** The user is likely working on a Docker project, as indicated by the presence of the Dockerfile. The environment is a Windows machine using Git Bash/MINGW64. The user is also exploring and attempting to use commands.

**Image Description:** The image is a screenshot of a terminal window. The content displayed consists of a series of commands and their outputs, likely related to a Docker setup within a Git repository (indicated by the "(main)" branch). Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Shell Prompt:** The standard shell prompt is visible, indicating the user is interacting with the command line. The prompt "hsent@DESKTOP-89FBVHS MINGW64" suggests the user is on a Windows machine (MINGW64 indicates a MinGW environment) and is logged in as the user "hsent". The "~" signifies the home directory and the "(main)" shows the user is currently working in the main branch of a Git repository.

2.  **`cd hello_world`:** The first command is `cd hello_world`, which changes the current directory to "hello\_world".

3.  **`$ ^[[200~ls -1 Dockerfile`:** The user attempted the `ls -1 Dockerfile` command (which is for listing the contents of a directory), but it was entered incorrectly, resulting in a garbled command with escape sequences.
    *   **Error Message:** The error message "bash: $'\E [200~1s': command not found" confirms that this particular command was not found.

4.  **`ls -1 Dockerfile`:**
    *   This is a listing command, executed in the "/hello\_world" directory.
    *   The `-l` option provides a long listing format, showing details about the file (permissions, size, date, name).
    *   The image lists one Dockerfile.

5.  **`DockerFile`: ** The ls -l command executed succesfully, and it displays the file type, permissions, number of links, owner, group, size, modification date, and filename `Dockerfile`.

6.  **`^C`:** This appears to be a control-C character sent to the terminal, likely to interrupt a running process or command.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a screenshot of an email, likely from a course or project. It appears to be an assessment or feedback message regarding a project submission.

**Key Elements and Text:**

*   **Header:**
    *   The email is from "22t1 se2002" and was sent at 1:27 am.
    *   It's addressed "to me."
*   **Body:**
    *   "Dear Learner," is the opening greeting.
    *   The email is discussing Project 1 and its prerequisite checks. It links to "TDS Project 1: Evaluation page".
    *   **Prerequisites:** The email lists 5 requirements that must be met for the project to be evaluated, including:
        1.  A publicly accessible GitHub repository.
        2.  A GitHub repository with an MIT license file.
        3.  A valid Dockerfile in the repository.
        4.  A publicly accessible Docker image that runs correctly.
        5.  The Docker image uses the same Dockerfile in the GitHub repository.
    *   The email states that failure to meet these requirements will lead to non-evaluation.
    *   **Evaluation Results:**
        *   The evaluation results for this submission are provided:
            *   "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS"
            *   "Is Github repo present AND public: FAIL"
            *   "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL"
            *   "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL"
        *   **Final Score:**
            *   "Prerequisites: FAIL"
            *   "Project 1 Score: 0"

**Visual Features:**

*   The email appears to be from a mobile device or a window with a responsive design.
*   The interface is clean, with a dark theme.

**In summary:** The email is a feedback report on a student's project submission. The student failed the prerequisites due to the lack of some essential elements, like a public GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license at the root of the github repo. The Docker Image was present, but there were still many fails.

I came pretty close, but too close(double entendre) to the deadline. Classic ICARUS stuff
