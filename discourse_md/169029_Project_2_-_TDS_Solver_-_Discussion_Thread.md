Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread

Creating this Thread to share answers and questions from your respective assignments

Why? 

If we can Train the LLM with these Questions already, we can easily do well? 

Too many Questions for LLM 

True we can use embeddings, map that stored in-system dictionary and use relevant questions from in-system data to send as context with answer

## Post #5 by 22f3002291 (Post ID: 602861)
Please quickly arrange a live TDS session to explain this project. There are a lot of doubts and questions in our minds.

---

## Post #6 by 22f3002291 (Post ID: 602866)
Please also give access to the answers for GAs. So that we can evaluate our api with the correct answers.

## Post #8 by 23f3001743 (Post ID: 602879)
If we use ngrok to create a tunnel to our API or Llamafile server, for how long should our terminal remain running? Should it be active only at the time of submission, or must it be continuously available until evaluation is completed?

---

## Post #9 by 23f2000573 (Post ID: 602883)
Is it like only the questions from the portal will be sent to the api?


If yes, is this project just about finding which question is asked and accordingly match the answer send the answer as response?

Hello Sir,


I understand that we can deploy on vercel. Can it be deployed on Heroku as well? I believe both serve the same purpose. Wanted to know your thoughts on the same sir.


Thanks and Regards

**Image Description:** The image shows a dark-grey/black screen containing text instructions related to deploying an application.¬†


The main heading is "Deploy your application" in a larger, white font.¬†


Below it, in a smaller white font, there's a paragraph of explanatory text: "Deploy your application to a public URL that can be accessed by anyone. You may use any platform, including Vercel."  This indicates the user should deploy their application to a publicly accessible URL and that they can do so using any platform, specifically mentioning Vercel as an example.  A thin light-grey line separates the heading from the explanatory paragraph.

If you use ngrok, ensure that it is running continuously until you get your results

---

## Post #12 by Jivraj (Post ID: 602898)
Any question from first 5 Ga‚Äôs can be there and you would need to analyze which question it is, you can use function calling or prompting as well. Function calling is better approach here.

---

## Post #13 by Jivraj (Post ID: 602899)
Hi 
@24f2006531


You can deploy it anywhere, just test how it works on Heroku, if it works(send request to api endpoint to your application and it should respond with answer)


Kind regards

## Post #14 by 22f3001315 (Post ID: 602932)
will the asked question be same which was asked in my GAs (i mean there were variations in problem statements for diff-diff students.)


@Jivraj
  sir

---

## Post #15 by Yogesh1 (Post ID: 602940)
Was the variation because of the datasets? Or even the problem statement?

---

## Post #16 by 22f3001315 (Post ID: 602947)
Mostly problem statement like different cities etc

---

## Post #17 by Yogesh1 (Post ID: 602948)
Then it comes down to what the project demands, as in what kind of questions the llm will be tested on (like you said). Hope the team can give us a test set like in the first project.

## Post #18 by nilaychugh (Post ID: 602956)
my question is some graded assignments have image files as a answer, so should our api return files as the answer or like can you clarify what type of answers we need to work on?

## Post #19 by 23f2000237 (Post ID: 602970)
I guess yes, our APIs should return photos if required

Could we have a tutorial-type session, similar to the one provided for Project 1, just before the deadline?

---

## Post #23 by 23f3001745 (Post ID: 603148)
There are a total of 57 questions in all 5 GAs(18+10+9+10+10).

Due to so many different formats of accepting questions and solving them, my main question is:

Is the main essence of this project related to deciphering cryptic js code in order to scrape it?


Some other doubts are




Some questions ask for you to access some hidden divs in the html page and use that for solving (like week 1 q11)


Some questions ask you for AIPROXY TOKENs (like week 3 q9)


Some questions required manual correction to get correct answers (like week 4 q2)


Some questions require file output (like week 2 q2)




How do we account for this?

## Post #24 by 23f2004837 (Post ID: 603156)
I have few questions just going through the Project 2 problem statement.




Are we supposed to use OpenAI api‚Äôs or locally/private hosted one?


Many of the questions need files or images or audio files as input, same api is expected to handle those also?


Can we work in a team and submit the project together?


If we are to use locally hosted llm system, our systems are not strong enough to run most of the good ones locally


Is it possible to get a TA to collaborate in our project as an observer?




awaiting a response.


Thank you‚Ä¶

Dear Sir,

I have few questions. It is written in the 
Tools in Data Science
 that we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I don‚Äôt think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below.




In GA 1 ques 13 and  GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI 
gh
  which we have to install in the vercel instance using 
apt
 package manager.

But, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages.


In GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that?

Also after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first install 
ngrok
 package.


In GA 2 ques 8,  uploading an image to Dockerhub requires 
docker
 package installed.


In GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance?


Many ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled. Can Vercel allow/do that?


And many more




Most tasks mentioned above like installing packages etc. requires sudo privilages or may face restrictions set by Vercel.

Vercel does not provide sudo access or any form of root access to its hosting environment which is required to perform the above tasks.


Many of these task can be done in our local systems (exposing to internet using cloudflare tunnels/ngrok), but we cannot run our systems 24*7 during evaluation.


I can see only one option left that is renting a VPS from server providers like digitalocean, gcp, aws etc, which will provide us sudo access and 100% uptime.


Also, some ques requires external toolings like




In GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365.


In GA1 ques 6, we have to use Devtools to show/find the hidden element in the question. Now, the question parameter in the POST request will be plain text, so how the element can hide there?


GA 2 ques 4 and GA 2 ques 5 uses Google Colab specific python libraries like google.colab which can‚Äôt be installed locally.




How to solve these above questions that require explicit usage of external tools.


Also, handling POST request for some questions are not clear like




In GA 2 ques 2, we have to compress the image and upload the image as answer. So, now how to response such answer in json object. Should we encode the resultant compressed image as base64 string or Image URL or  Data URI.


Some ques have images in them. For those images in GAs, I right clicked and used ‚ÄúSave as‚Äù to save the images and then done the required computations. So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment?




Another concern is regarding the OpenAI API TOKEN, unlike Project 1, Project 2 does not have an API_TOKEN parameter in the POST request. Hence, the API TOKEN provided from 
https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev
 will be also used during evaluation. Now, what will happen if our API TOKEN credits gets end during evaluation. The LLM will throw errors then.


Please advise what we should do. please clarify Sir.

## Post #31 by Saransh_Saini (Post ID: 603863)
If you are talking about the parameters of those questions, then it would be better if you make your API capable of working with different parameters.

---

## Post #32 by Saransh_Saini (Post ID: 603865)
Well if your API is capable of solving those questions in your GAs with the expected answer, then that‚Äôs sufficient validation.

---

## Post #33 by Saransh_Saini (Post ID: 603870)
If you are indicating towards working collaboratively then,

Yes, we encourage you to collaborate with others and collectively work towards solving this project. Even if you are going for the relatively easiest approach of Function Calling, it would require you to code about 50 functions to solve all your tasks. Which is why it is sensible to work collectively.

## Post #34 by 24f2006531 (Post ID: 603917)
Hello Sir,


I have a few questions. Would like your thoughts and suggestions over the same.






Currently answers that we have entered for GA‚Äôs 1 to 4 are not available and only for GA5 its available. It would be helpful for the project (when running the Curl command for each of the question) if the assignments can display the answers we‚Äôve entered as well for verification purposes.






The first question of GA1 q1 needs for us to run vs code but when executing it through vercel its not possible because vercel is a serverless environment. In this case, is it okay to manually enter the answer in the code, so when the question is triggered it takes the manual output from the code.






Can you provide some clarity as to how the question is supposed to be and structured ? Or should the code be able to handle multiple variants of the question? To address this concern, i tried to implement sentence_transformers using a lightweight model but the vercel application build failed saying that the data is too long and that Vercel serverless function deployment size exceeds the limit of 250 MB. Should i consider deploying elsewhere or change the approach?






How do we handle questions pertaining to Devtools - creating input box etc.






Thanks and Regards

Shalini

## Post #35 by 23f1002382 (Post ID: 604066)
What does it mean to solve the question?

Everyone is asking that?

Do you yourself know what to do and to go about it?

Or just pull out something from your hAtSS at the last moment?


‚Äúand responds with the answer to enter in the assignment.‚Äù

From my understanding only those questions that are solved with a program and give an answer are to be considered‚Ä¶ For example it states in the project that 

" The response must be a JSON object with a single text (string) field: 
answer
 that can be directly entered in the assignment. For example:"

If you all still have not responded, then I‚Äôm honestly not sure if this is what y‚Äôall meant.

Last project was not clear to some extent, This time its even more vague.


I understand that y‚Äôall want to give different projects to help High Order Thinking skills, but if not executed properly, no one actually learns anything and we(I) just end by debugging the project statement code and question with no relevance to the project. If we wanted to do that, I could just go random GitHub repos and solve and create pull requests for a specific bug. Also we end up losing interest thinking most if the course instructors don‚Äôt what they are doing. I understand Anand Sir is extremely busy(like really busy lol), but what are the course instructors doing?

I just want to know if you prefer using an existing language model application where we utilize an LLM (Large Language Model), train it, and format the output. For instance, I used the Gemini API key, integrated it with Python, and then formatted the results with the help of Copilot to achieve the desired outputs.


Alternatively, do you want us to create a new LLM model and train it with questions from graded assignments? I‚Äôm curious about your preference.


Additionally, would you like the LLM to provide specific answers regarding computer specifications, or should it give general specifications? For example, in Graded Assignment 1, there is a question about the editor: Visual Studio Code.


Your editor is the most important tool in your arsenal; that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll spend most of your time, so make sure you‚Äôre comfortable with it.


Visual Studio Code is, by far, the most popular code editor today. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you‚Äôll likely work with others who use VS Code, so having some exposure is beneficial.


To get started, you can watch these introductory videos (totaling 35 minutes) from the Visual Studio Docs:




Getting Started: Set up and learn the basics of Visual Studio Code (7 min)


Code Editing: Learn how to edit and run code in VS Code (3 min)


Productivity Tips: Become a VS Code power user with these productivity tips (4 min)


Personalize: Personalize VS Code to make it yours with themes (2 min)


Extensions: Add features, themes, and more to VS Code with extensions (4 min)


Debugging: Get started with debugging in VS Code (6 min)


Version Control: Learn how to use Git version control in VS Code (3 min)


Customize: Learn how to customize your settings and keyboard shortcuts in VS Code (6 min)




AI Editors: Copilot, Cursor


Note: AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help you write code faster. These tools are built on top of VS Code and have become standard in every developer‚Äôs toolkit. Please make sure to use them.


To install and run Visual Studio Code, open your Terminal (or Command Prompt) and type 
code -s
, then press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below.


What is the output of 
code -s
? The output of 
code -s
 cannot be universally answered because it depends on the user‚Äôs system and the specific version of VS Code installed. The question requests the output of a command that is unique to each user.


As for the part about getting answers from the LLM model, I believe that may require using an AI agent. I am currently searching for a solution for this, and I would like to know your thoughts on it.

**Image Description:** The image shows a webpage for an "IIT Madras Assignment Helper" tool.  The main content is divided into sections:

**1. Header:**  The title "IIT Madras Assignment Helper" is prominently displayed, followed by a brief description stating that the tool helps find answers to graded assignments in IIT Madras Data Science.

**2. Question Input Area:** This section is labeled "Ask a Question." It contains a text box where a user inputs their assignment question. In this case, the user has entered a question that asks to write a DuckDB SQL query to retrieve post IDs meeting specific criteria (timestamp after a given date, at least one comment with 5 useful stars), sorted in ascending order.  A "Choose File" button allows the user to upload an assignment file (optional).  A "Get Answer" button initiates the query processing.

**3. Answer Section:** This section, labeled "Answer," displays the generated SQL query that answers the user's question. The query uses several functions, including `json_each` and `json_extract`, to parse JSON data within the `comments` field and filter based on the `stars.useful` attribute.  The result is ordered by `post_id`.

**4. Other features:**  There are small, numbered editing/comment icons near the question input area; their function is unclear from the image itself.

In summary, the image depicts a functional web application designed to aid students with their SQL-related assignments by providing solutions to their queries and code generation. The specific question and answer shown illustrate the tool's capabilities in handling JSON data within a SQL context.

**Image Description:** The image shows a terminal window displaying a `curl` command and its output.  Let's break down the content:

* **The Command:** `D:\Yantravid>curl -X POST "https://yantravid-git-main-vicky-kumars-projects-5400c012.vercel.app/api/" -F "question=what is 2+2?"` This is a `curl` command that sends a POST request to a specific URL.

    * `-X POST`: Specifies that the request method is POST.
    * `"https://yantravid-git-main-vicky-kumars-projects-5400c012.vercel.app/api/"`: This is the URL of the API endpoint being called. The URL suggests a Vercel deployment of a project named  `yantravid-git-main-vicky-kumars-projects`.
    * `-F "question=what is 2+2?"`: This part sends data to the API. It's a form-data submission with a field named `question` containing the value "what is 2+2?".

* **The Output:** `{"answer":"4"}` This is the JSON response from the API.  It indicates that the API successfully received and processed the question "what is 2+2?" and returned the correct answer, "4".

* **The Prompt:** `D:\Yantravid>` This is the command prompt, indicating the current directory is `Yantravid` on a Windows system.  The second `D:\Yantravid>` shows the command prompt after the curl command has executed.

In summary, the image demonstrates a simple interaction with a math-solving API via a `curl` command, where the API correctly answers a basic arithmetic question. The API likely uses a calculation engine to process the question and produce the answer.

**Image Description:** This image shows a terminal session (likely in Windows) demonstrating a coding challenge.  The key elements are:

* **cURL command:** The initial lines show a `curl` command that sends a POST request to a specific URL ("https://yantravid-git-main-vicky-kumars-projects-5400c012.vercel.app/api/").  The request includes a question and a file.

* **The Question:** The question describes a series of file manipulation steps:
    1. Download and extract a zip file named `qmove.zip`.
    2. Move all files from subfolders into a single directory.
    3. Rename all files by incrementing each digit (1 becomes 2, 9 becomes 0).
    4. Finally, determine the output of the command `grep * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum`.


* **The File:** A file named `qmove.zip` located at `D:\Yantravid\yantravid\test_data\qmove.zip` is provided as input.

* **The Response (Answer):** The final lines show a JSON response containing an "answer" field with a long hexadecimal string:  `ne086115d65479e8562262a61e17e4568880561732b2d6e81117e041681883191`. This string is likely the SHA256 checksum of the processed files, as predicted by the question.

In summary, the image documents a program that solves a file processing puzzle and returns the SHA256 checksum of the results, validating the solution. The hexadecimal string is the crucial piece of information indicating the successful completion and verification of the steps outlined in the problem.

**Image Description:** The image contains text describing an API endpoint.  The key information is:

* **API Endpoint URL:** `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/`  This is the address of the API endpoint.  Note that "your-app" is a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual application name.

* **Request Method:** The endpoint accepts `POST` requests.

* **Request Data:**  The endpoint accepts data in the body of the POST request.  This includes a "question" (the exact format of which is not specified) and optionally, file attachments. The file attachments must be in the `multipart/form-data` format, a standard format for sending files along with other data.

In short, the text instructs how to send data to a Vercel-hosted API endpoint using a POST request, and allows for optional file uploads.

* **Questions:** Students should use a Discourse thread (link not provided in the image) for questions.
* **Project Background:** The project involves creating an LLM-based application to automatically answer graded assignment questions.  The context is that the student is enrolled in the "Tools in Data Science" course within IIT Madras' Online Degree in Data Science.

The overall style suggests this is a project description or assignment brief for a data science course.  The use of "LLM-based application" indicates the project leverages large language models.

**Image Description:** Here's a description of the image's content:

The image shows a dark-themed discussion thread, likely from an online learning platform or similar system.  The thread is titled "+ Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread".  Above the title are tags or categories indicating that it's related to "Courses," "Tools in Data Science," "announcement," "term1-2025," and "tds-project-2".

The main post is by a user named "s.anand (Course_faculty)".  It requests questions related to "Project 2 - TDS Solver," noting that there are 71 views. A deadline is set for Monday, March 31, 2025, at 11:59 PM.

Below the main post are statistics: 530 views, 32 likes, 3 links, and 24 users involved.  Small profile pictures of some of these users are also visible. The post is marked as "Pinned on Mar 3".

On the right, a "9d" indicates the thread was posted 9 days ago and "6 min read" suggests an estimated reading time. There are standard social media-like interaction buttons: a heart (5 likes), a link icon, three dots (more options), and a reply button. The overall visual style is consistent with many modern online learning platforms.

## Post #47 by carlton (Post ID: 607328)
Hi Ayush,


Just go the AI Proxy token issue page and re-issue it or use the same one. The limits get reset.

Kind regards

My Approach , is to




scrape and parse all the current question


create embeddings ,  of the questions.


create a test endpoint , just to check if i am able to correctly identify the questions


segregate numerical , string and json responses and see if these can be answered part of phase 1


Phase 2 , experiment with url based answers. need to see if an MCP server can come in handy

to deploy a server and return an url

## Post #49 by 23f2001286 (Post ID: 607367)
Since the token is limited, I have thought to use the run llms locally,  to check for the accuracy of solving the question.




I want to know which LLM will be more closer to the one used for evaluating our project.


Does the model used for evaluation is capable for handling raw files, or we need to pass it in the text format..(As as I am to recall, the models are capable enough to handle the files..)

Thanks!




Does anyone willing to work with me..?

## Post #50 by 24f1001599 (Post ID: 607416)
Should we answer the questions and return the response to enter in the answer box(as stated in the question) or should we just provide instructions on how to go about solving the question? Some of the questions include pictures and we cannot use LLM for pictures.

They(instructors) only don‚Äôt what to do it looks like, Anand Sir will tell them and they will tell you (with 25-50 percent lossy communication), just wait and keeping tagging Anand Sir. He will explain clearly, Ask everyone to push for a live session with Anand Sir , that 40 mins he explains will be worth its weight in gold, Hope he does that. Flattery gets me everywhere (not really, I really think Anand Sir is OP. Check out his YT

should we make the functions on the basis of the GAs or should we make it general so it will be able to perform the task but the data provided will be different.

## Post #55 by carlton (Post ID: 607978)
The key learning objective for Project 2 is for you to be absolutely comfortable interacting with APIs and understanding how they work to perform tasks.


So there is very little need for the use of LLMs or agents.




Identify the the question being asked (how you do this is upto you, you can be as simplistic as using regex to look for some key words, or you can be clever and create embeddings out of the original question and calculate the similarity from the request)


Create a function that solves the question with the required parameters and inputs. Remember this does not have to be fancy. Just compute the answer. You do not need to do the task as the GA required. You ONLY want the answer. No tools required. Just a computed answer.


Give the answer back as specified.




Kind regards

Does this mean this type of question won‚Äôt be paramaterized?




Like instead of 
code -s
 there won‚Äôt be any other command, otherwise it would require installation of VS Code inside a container to find the answer or this type of questions won‚Äôt be part of evaluation at all?


The same confusion is for these type of questions as well:

**Image Description:** The image contains text instructions and a question related to a command-line operation in Visual Studio Code.

The instructions state:  "Install and run Visual Studio Code. In your Terminal (or Command Prompt), type `code -s` and press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below."  The  `code -s` is highlighted, suggesting it's a command to be executed.

The question asks: "What is the output of `code -s`?"  This implies that the answer should be the output from running the specified command in a terminal or command prompt window.  The image itself doesn't provide the answer; it's requesting the user to provide the output after executing the command.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/7/5/7526d6eeacedc3b8dbec38fd07fb631d503f0665_2_690x389.png)

**Image Description:** This image contains a screenshot of a quiz or assignment with two parts, each testing the user's ability to write and interpret formulas in spreadsheet software.


**Part 1: Google Sheets**

This section instructs the user to type the following formula into Google Sheets:

`=SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 15, 6), 1, 10))`

The user is then asked to input the result of this formula in a provided text box and then click the "Check" button to submit their answer.  A note clarifies that this formula will not work in Excel.


**Part 2: Excel (Office 365)**

This section focuses on Excel. The user is told this part of the quiz requires Office 365, stating it "will ONLY work in Office 365". The formula to be entered into Excel is:

`=SUM(TAKE(SORTBY((3,14,6,10,3,12,9,6,3,12,15,4,11,11,4,14),(10,9,13,2,11,8,16,14,7,15,5,4,6,1,3,12)),1,9))`

Similar to Part 1, the user must enter the result in a text box and click the "Check" button.  There's a note explaining that a "#NAME?" error indicates the user is using an incorrect version of Excel.


In short, the image presents a test of spreadsheet formula understanding, specifically targeting Google Sheets' `ARRAY_CONSTRAIN` and `SEQUENCE` functions and Excel's `TAKE` and `SORTBY` functions (in Office 365).  The differing functionality highlights the variations between spreadsheet programs.

there will not be any other command. This question can be solved with a hardcoded answer


Excel and Google sheet questions can be solved by just using python . No excel or google sheets required.


The question WILL be parameterised however. So the numbers might be different. You should just understand what the question is asking and solve it programatically to get the answer.

Means no github, image related, vs-code, vercel, etc. will be there

And the answer will be in string format ??

## Post #61 by carlton (Post ID: 608168)
I am not sure how you came to that conclusion!


For example vercel question still requires a vercel endpoint that will respond.


What I said is some questions might not need you to use those specific tools. Your answers should still be legitimate answers that one can paste into the text box of a GA and still get it correct.


The only question that will not be asked is the LLM say yes question.


A github account would still need you to commit a file to it and provide the url that is reachable.


etc.

**Image Description:** That's an image of a simple, stylized clock face.¬†


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Shape and Color:** The clock is round with a light blue/teal bezel and a slightly off-white or cream-colored face.  The overall style is simplistic and slightly cartoonish.

* **Hands:** It has two hands: an hour hand and a minute hand. Both are dark brown. The hour hand points to the number 7 (or slightly before), and the minute hand points to the 12.

* **Numbers/Markers:** The clock shows only the hour markings, represented by small dashes. No numbers are explicitly visible.

* **Time:** The clock shows approximately **7:00** or **7 o'clock**.

The lack of numbers and the simplistic style suggest it's likely an icon or graphic element rather than a highly detailed clock representation.  The focus is clearly on communicating the approximate time.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/9/b9484a4812e4e431a40e97e94907a9c654456ebb.png)

**Image Description:** That's an image of a simple, pixelated drawing of a microphone.¬†


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Style:** The microphone is depicted in a low-resolution, pixel art style.  The edges are not smooth; instead, they are made up of clearly defined squares.

* **Color Palette:** The microphone is primarily dark gray/silver. There's a light blue band around the microphone head.

* **Shape and Design:**  It's a standard handheld microphone design with a rounded head and a cylindrical body. A small, dark circle is visible on the body, possibly representing a switch or indicator light.

* **Lack of Text:** There is no text present in the image.


Because of its simplistic nature, the image doesn't offer many details beyond the basic representation of a microphone.  It could be used as an icon to represent audio, recording, speaking, or similar concepts.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/d/5d0b610f9487ac70603819651fb2c472635c17de.png)

**Image Description:** That's a digital illustration of a red pushpin, rendered in a pixel art style.¬†


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Color:** The head of the pushpin is a shade of reddish-orange, while the pin itself is light gray/silver.  The colors are fairly simple and blocky, consistent with pixel art.

* **Shape:** The head is a rounded, slightly asymmetrical shape, not perfectly smooth. The pin is straight and relatively thin.

* **Style:** The style is clearly low-resolution pixel art, indicating a potentially simple or retro design aesthetic.  The edges are jagged and not smooth curves.

* **No Text:** There is no text present in the image.


The image is likely an icon or symbol representing pinning, saving, or bookmarking in a digital context, given its simple design and common association with these actions.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/a/da3d7fa22946354584e940fd75549ae249ce39b9.png)

**Image Description:** That's a simple, pixelated image of two interlocking links, resembling a chain.¬†


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Shape and Style:** The image is a stylized representation of two chain links, not a photorealistic depiction.  It's clearly low-resolution (pixel art), with a slightly smoothed, almost 3D-like effect suggesting depth to the metal-like links. The links are oval-shaped.

* **Color:** The links are a light, pastel blue or cyan.  There's a slightly darker shade used for shadowing or highlighting to give a sense of three-dimensionality.  The background is transparent.

* **Meaning:** The image universally symbolizes a link, connection, or association. It's frequently used online to represent hyperlinks or connections between different things.  There is no text present.


The lack of text makes its specific context ambiguous.  It could be used in many different applications where connection is implied.

Hi TAs,


I attended the meet which happened today. But I don‚Äôt clearly get one thing.


Most of the questions have a 
question text
 and a 
file: csv,zip,json,etc


My doubt is, will the request to the end point be :


curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question text" \
  -F "file=https://stats.espncricinfo.com/stats/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;template=results;type=batting"





my doubt :

Is this the only format or can there be other too ?

---

## Post #67 by Jivraj (Post ID: 608614)
Hi 
@23f2000573


Yes this is correct format for the question, It will have 2 fields question and file.


You can send a file from local machine like this  
-F "file=@abcd.zip"
 so here 
abcd.zip
 must be in current working directory.


Kind regards

---

## Post #68 by 23f2000573 (Post ID: 608672)
Fine sir, this is clear. I have a few doubts in the file formats. When free, kindly address these to. I will try to cover most common doubts, so that you wouldn‚Äôt need to answer similar doubts again. Sorry if some of the doubts are basic / written incorrectly.


FILES


The data file sent to the api will always be in the 
requester‚Äôs
 local machine. When the api server receives the request, the file will be in binary format?


Or


Sometimes the api server receives the file in byte and some times, it will recieve a link like this :  
https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png


This link was take from GA2 Question 2


HTML AND TABLE


Some questions have 
html
 and 
tables
. In this case will these two be in a file encoded in binary, or will it be a string.


Example for string. Consider the table










Col 1


Col 2










Row 1, Col1


Row 1 Col 2






Row 2, Col 1


Row 2 Col 2








Will this be something like this


"|Col 1| Col 2|\n|-|-|\n|Row 1, Col1 | Row 1 Col 2|\n|Row 2, Col 1|Row 2 Col 2|"



or something like


"<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Col 1</th>\n<th>Col 2</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 1, Col1</td>\n<td>Row 1 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 2, Col 1</td>\n<td>Row 2 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>
"



HIDDEN BLOCK AND ANSWER : 2 TASKS


In one question, there were two tasks.




Find the answer to the question


Enable the 
disabled
 text block




In this question, what will the answer type be?


Should it just be the answer or should it be the html string which will have the disabled block enabled and also the answer string sitting inside the block


MORE THAN ONE FILE


Some questions have more than one file. For example, the last question of GA5, it has a png file in this link 
https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/jigsaw.webp
 and a table.


In this case, how will the curl request be? Is it some thing like this


curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question text" \
  -F "file= Image file" \
  -F "file= table file/ string" 



CORS HEADERS


Will the CORS headers asked in the question be the same or can it be different?

---

## Post #69 by 22f3001307 (Post ID: 608769)
Hi,

In GA 2, q5, this is the code i got in the question.


import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
from google.colab import files
import colorsys

# There is a mistake in the line below. Fix it
image = Image.open(list(files.upload().keys)[0])

rgb = np.array(image) / 255.0
lightness = np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: colorsys.rgb_to_hls(*x)[1], 2, rgb)
light_pixels = np.sum(lightness > 0.554)
print(f'Number of pixels with lightness > 0.554: {light_pixels}')



Is this the code for others as well?

Thanks

## Post #70 by 21f2000709 (Post ID: 608789)
So I was thinking to create the project 2 together and I was looking for collaboration, and for that we would require the following:


 ‚Üí the set of question-answers pairs at first

 ‚Üí All the questions of 2 distinct students to see which parameters changes in each questions

 ‚Üí Make the solution functional and parameterised based on previous step.


Till now I have created the following:


 ‚Üí Identification of the question, using embeddings

 ‚Üí extraction of parameters using llm for that particular question

 ‚Üí Implementation of 3 questions using this approach


If we come together, we all can reduce the workload and complete it on time.


*Those who resonate with my approach or have any different approach feel free to leave a DM. I might not respond immediately as I might not be online all the time

file format will be exactly same as corresponding GA.

"<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Col 1</th>\n<th>Col 2</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 1, Col1</td>\n<td>Row 1 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 2, Col 1</td>\n<td>Row 2 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>







This is correct html table format.








 23f2000573:

Sir, a few things are not yet clear .








 Jivraj:




file format will be exactly same as corresponding GA.






Some questions have 
clickable html buttons
. When we click that, the zipfile or json file, or csv gets downloaded


Some questions have 
image attached to the text
. For this, we have to use 
right click ‚Üí download the image
. Here, the image is take from some url. For example. in GA2, q2, the image displayed is taken from 
https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png
.


My doubt is, what will be the value of file attribute in curl command


Will it be




‚Äúfile=binary of zipfile/csv/json‚Äù for the first type and


‚Äúfile=
https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png
‚Äù for the second type










 Jivraj:




This is correct html table format.






Will this table be in the ‚Äúquestion‚Äù attribute of curl or ‚Äúfile‚Äù attribute








 Jivraj:




In last question of GA5 there is only one file(image), table is not coming through file, it will be kept same for project2.






so, can I assume that the table will be given as a html element in the ‚Äúquestion‚Äù attribute and the image in the ‚Äúfile‚Äù attribute?

**Image Description:** Here's a description of the image:

The image is a close-up screenshot from a Google Meet video call.¬†


**The Person:** The main focus is a man with graying hair, tan skin, and a serious expression. He appears to be middle-aged. He's wearing a light gray or off-white shirt and has what looks like a small, light-colored microphone or earpiece attached to his ears.  A bit of white powder or dust is visible on his chin and neck area.

**The Background:** The background is a plain, off-white wall. There's a simple electrical outlet visible on the left side of the frame. A portion of a white board or wall is visible in the upper right corner, showing faint markings that could be writing or smudges. The Google Meet logo is present in the upper right corner.

**Text:**  In the bottom left corner, the name "Anand S" is visible, likely the name of the participant in the Google Meet call.


**Overall:** The image appears to be a simple, straightforward video call capture, possibly taken for identification or record-keeping purposes within a remote meeting. The slightly dusty appearance could suggest the setting might not be a highly professional one.

For questions that have table they will either come as html code or as markdown. Keep a if else condition for identifying which case it is, if it‚Äôs a html then beautiful soup should be able to find table tag, if it‚Äôs markdown table then it can be identified with 
|

For GA 1, question 2


Screenshot 2025-03-21 at 4.17.09 PM

The portal accept answers in strict json with double quotes. Now in the project we need to return the answer in string value which again has double quotes, so the best answer I could get is using 
\"
 inside the answer like this.




But still the GA portal marks it as invalid json. What to do in this case?

**Image Description:** The image contains a coding challenge.  The top section describes a command:  `uv run --with httpie -- https [URL]` which installs the `httpie` Python package and then sends an HTTPS request to a specified URL.

Specifically, it instructs to send a HTTPS request to `https://httpbin.org/get` with a URL encoded parameter `email` set to `21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.

The bottom section asks for the JSON output of that command. The user is instructed to paste *only* the JSON body, excluding the headers.  A partially filled-in JSON response is shown as a starting point. The beginning of the JSON body shows the "args" section containing the email.  The "headers" section is partially shown with "Accept" and "Accept-Encoding" keys.


A button labeled "Check" is visible, presumably to submit the user's answer.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/1/e/1e4550c6e2637e7cf226d943eb61ccb0a8f96770.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a snippet of code, likely from a programming language like Python or JavaScript, that constructs a JSON object.  The JSON object appears to be part of a request, perhaps to an API,  and contains at least two key-value pairs:

* **`answer`**: This is the outermost key of the JSON object. Its value is another JSON object.

* **`args`**: This key's value is a nested JSON object containing a single key-value pair:
    * **`email`**: The value here is an email address: `21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.  This suggests that the request may be related to a user with this email address.

* **`headers`**: This key holds another nested JSON object representing HTTP headers for the request.  It includes:
    * **`Accept`**:  The value `*/*` indicates that the client is willing to accept any media type in the response.
    * **`Accept-Encoding`**: The value is partially visible, suggesting a preference for certain data compression methods (likely `deflate` or similar). There is a trailing parenthesis suggesting incomplete code.


The code snippet lacks proper syntax and formatting, particularly in the `headers` section, making it appear as if it's only a partial representation of the full JSON structure.  There is also a portion of a string that seems unrelated or potentially part of a comment (`doflato)` and ` "Hoct"` near the end.  Without seeing the surrounding context and the full code, it's hard to determine the code's complete purpose.

This works, just send a string which can be loaded as json object.

**Image Description:** The image shows a code snippet from a Python interpreter session.  It demonstrates manipulating JSON data.

Let's break down the code line by line:

* **`In [28]: jobj`**: This line shows the user is requesting the value of the variable `jobj`.

* **`Out [28]: "{'name':'jivraj'}"`**: This is the output, showing the variable `jobj` holds a string representation of a JSON object. Note that the JSON is represented as a Python string literal.

* **`In [29]: jobj = '{"name":"jivraj"}'`**: The user assigns a JSON string (a string literal containing valid JSON data) to the variable `jobj`.

* **`In [30]: jobj`**: Again, the user requests the value of `jobj`.

* **`Out [30]: '{"name":"jivraj"}'`**: The output shows the value hasn't changed; it's still the JSON string.

* **`In [31]: json.loads(jobj)`**: The user uses the `json.loads()` function from the `json` library to parse the JSON string and convert it into a Python dictionary.

* **`Out [31]: {'name': 'jivraj'}`**: The output shows the successful parsing.  `jobj` is now a Python dictionary with a single key-value pair.

* **`In [32]: json.loads(jobj)['name']`**:  The user accesses the value associated with the key "name" within the dictionary.

* **`Out [32]: 'jivraj'`**: The output shows only the value 'jivraj'.

* **`In [33]: type(jobj)`**: The user checks the data type of `jobj`.

* **`Out [33]: str`**: The output shows that `jobj` is still a string despite being parsed in line 31. The `json.loads()` function *creates a new Python dictionary object*, but it does not modify the original `jobj` variable.


* **`In [34]: |`**:  This appears to be the beginning of a new input line in the interactive interpreter.


In summary, the code illustrates the difference between a string representation of JSON data and a parsed JSON object in Python.  It shows how `json.loads()` parses the string into a dictionary and how to access elements of the dictionary using square bracket notation.

The correct answer has to be with the escape sequence otherwise you cannot send a valid response back.

We never feed your response to the GA by copy pasting.

**Image Description:** The image shows a code snippet and its output.  The code appears to be Python, using the `json` library to handle JSON data.

**Code Breakdown:**

1. **`response = {"answer": '{ "args": {"challenge": "How can TDS ever hope to solve this problem?" } }'`**: This line creates a Python dictionary called `response`. The `"answer"` key holds a JSON string representing a challenge.  Note that this string is improperly formatted as it's using both single and double quotes, which should be consistent.

2. **`import json`**: Imports the `json` library, which allows for encoding and decoding JSON objects.

3. **`send_response = json.dumps(response, indent=2)`**: This line uses `json.dumps()` to convert the `response` dictionary into a JSON formatted string, with indentation for readability (indent=2).

4. **`print(send_response)`**: Prints the formatted JSON string to the console.  The output shows the nicely formatted JSON.

5. **`tds_evaluator = json.loads(send_response)['answer']`**: This line uses `json.loads()` to parse the JSON string back into a Python dictionary. It then accesses the `"answer"` key in the parsed dictionary and stores it in `tds_evaluator`.

6. **`print(tds_evaluator)`**: Prints the value associated with the `"answer"` key (which is itself a dictionary).  The output shows a dictionary containing the challenge.

7. **`print("OH MY GOODNESS! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! THIS IS AMAZING!")`**: This line prints an exclamation to the console.

**Output:**

The console output in the image shows the following:

*   The nicely formatted JSON string created by `json.dumps()`.
*   The dictionary obtained by parsing the JSON string using `json.loads()`.
*   The excited message printed in the last line.


**Relevant Features:**

*   The use of `json.dumps()` and `json.loads()` highlights the process of converting between Python dictionaries and JSON strings.
*   The challenge "How can TDS ever hope to solve this problem?"  is the core data being processed.
*   The final output expresses apparent excitement or surprise, suggesting that the code successfully processed and extracted the challenge from the JSON data.
The inconsistent use of quotation marks in the initial `response` dictionary suggests that there might be a subtle error in the initial coding of the `response` variable.  Proper formatting should use either single or double quotes consistently throughout the string.

So the questions expecting JSON will be jsonified separately before passing to the evaluator because in the current implementation in the text field idk why it is failing to load the json with

 however I could load the exact thing using json.loads in python.

For questions like this (there‚Äôs a similar one in GA1 too, will the user send the USER and REPO of their GitHub account as parameters too?

Even if they do, my script may not get necessary authentication to create repo and make commit in their repository. In this case, would I have to implement GitHub OAuth flow?

If they don‚Äôt send those details but just the email and I am expected to just change the email in my own repo and commit, in the worst case making the same change repeatedly may be misconstrued as a DDoS attack by an automated script which may lead to my GitHub account being suspended, which does not seem ideal.

Can you please at least hint at a solution?

**Image Description:** The image shows a mobile phone screen displaying a coding assignment or tutorial.  The content focuses on using GitHub Pages to publish a webpage.

**Key details:**

* **Instruction:** The main task is to create a GitHub Pages website that showcases work and includes a specific email address (22f3000819@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) within the HTML.  The instructions emphasize that GitHub Pages uses Cloudflare, which obfuscates emails, so the email should be wrapped within a specific HTML comment (`<!--email_off--> ... <--email_off-->`).  The provided example code snippet is incomplete.

* **Email Obfuscation:** The instructions explain that GitHub Pages, served via Cloudflare, obfuscates emails.  This is why the email address needs to be wrapped within a special comment to prevent it from being hidden.

* **GitHub Pages URL:**  The assignment asks for the student to identify their GitHub Pages URL, which would follow a specific structure (`https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/`). A text input field is provided for the user to enter their URL.

* **Cache Busting:** Instructions are provided to deal with a situation where a recently made change isn't reflected on the live site. Adding "?v=1" or "?v=2" to the URL is suggested to bypass the cache.

* **"Check" Button:** A button labeled "Check" is visible, suggesting a mechanism for submitting the URL.

* **Google Colab:** A separate task mentions using Google Colab (with a 0.5 mark allocation), indicating that other parts of the assignment might involve using this collaborative coding environment.

* **Top Bar:** The top bar shows a time (12:30), some notification icons, a percentage (83%), and a website address (anand.workers.dev) which is likely related to the assignment's context.  There is also a screenshot of some code, presumably related to the assignment.


In short, the image depicts a step-by-step guide for a student completing a coding task involving GitHub Pages, email obfuscation, and URL structure.

Hello.. I am facing issue with zip file extraction function which is in many GA1 questions. e.g., for GA1 Q15, if I use 7-zip to extract files, it shows the correct total size when using Postman for local server. If I use python built-in function, it calculates a different value (which is incorrect). So, I used 7-zip. But I (with help from copilot agent) am not able to make 7-zip work on the vercel deployment. Can we just hard code the answers to GA1 questions, or is there a way to take answer from local server and use it for response in vercel (sorry, it doesn‚Äôt even make sense to me, but a lot of things are hard to understand anyway)? Or how do we resolve this 7-zip issue. Python built-in extraction did not work correctly even after hours of trying..


I have another question. Due to lack of time, if I just submit the Project 2, with question/answers to GA1, (and if these all work as expected on vercel), how much approx score can we get if I am not able to do other GAs at all for Project 2. Edit after posting: I can hard code questions and other answers from GA2 upto GA4 (I missed GA5, so don‚Äôt have those answers). Thank you.

## Post #93 by 21f2000709 (Post ID: 609968)
I too want to know like by 5 questions at random, is it 1 random question per GA or 5 random questions from the entire 5 GAs?


In the later case, there would be no certainty unless all of our questions works and there aren‚Äôt any unexpected surprises at the evaluation.

**Image Description:** The image shows a section of text describing the impact of automating the extraction and processing of bounding box data for UrbanRide.  This is followed by a question and answer section.

The question asks for the minimum latitude of the bounding box for the city of Tianjin, China, as retrieved from the Nominatim API.  

A user has entered "38.566" as the answer.  However, below the answer box, an error message appears: "Error: Incorrect latitude. Check OSM ID ending with 2077". This indicates the provided latitude is incorrect, and suggests checking the Open Street Map (OSM) ID ending in 2077 for the correct data.  The text above explains the benefits of this bounding box data automation for route optimization, fleet allocation, market analysis, and scaling operations.

**Image Description:** This image shows a GitHub repository page for a project named "TDS_Project_2" by the user "Tusharisme".  

Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Repository Name:** The main title displays "Tusharisme/TDS_Project_2".  This indicates the username ("Tusharisme") and the project name ("TDS_Project_2").

* **Project Icon:** A small, stylized icon is present, appearing as a pixel art representation of a face or symbol. It's likely a custom icon chosen by the repository owner.

* **Repository Statistics:** Below the main title, the following statistics are shown:
    * **Contributor:** 1
    * **Issues:** 0
    * **Stars:** 0
    * **Forks:** 0
    These numbers indicate the current level of community involvement with the project.

* **GitHub Logo:** The bottom right corner displays the familiar GitHub logo (a stylized cat). This confirms the page's origin.

The overall impression is that this is a relatively new or under-developed project on GitHub with minimal community interaction so far.  The "TDS" in the project name likely refers to some project-specific acronym, without further context.

Because the raw string when pasted in the text box of the GA isn‚Äôt getting the markdown.






In case of image compression question, should I return the base64 encoding of the compressed image?

Respected TDS Team,


I currently have Three doubts regarding 
Project 2
:






As per the 19th March session, it was mentioned that the files would be the same for everyone, and only the parameters in the questions would vary. However, I have noticed that the files can actually be different. To support this, I‚Äôm attaching screenshots of the CSV files for GA5 Q1‚Äîone is mine, and the other belongs to a batchmate.


mydata
939√ó401 18.3 KB


friend data
938√ó465 20.5 KB

During the session, it was said that uploading files would take time, and the suggested solution was to pre-download the files on the server since they are supposed to be the same. But since the files are not identical for all students, this issue needs to be addressed.






In 
GA4 Q2
, my task is to retrieve movie information from IMDb for all films with a rating between 3 and 5. I am scraping the correct movie names(for example 6th movie in given image), but the portal is accepting them differently. All movie names are provided in English, but the portal seems to be accepting some titles in other languages‚ÄîSpanish, Dutch, I believe.

Please check the issue in the images provided. How to handle this question.






In 
GA4 Q10
, very few students were able to solve the question using LLMs or Python during the assignment. Most of us ended up solving it manually. At that time, 
@carlton
 sir had mentioned that the question would be revised.

Here is the 
thread link
 for reference.

How should we handle this question now?

**Image Description:** The image contains a spreadsheet-like table showing sales data.  The table has the following columns:

* **TransactionID:** A unique numerical identifier for each transaction (e.g., 0001, 0002).
* **Customer Name:** The name of the customer involved in the transaction (e.g., John Doe, Frank Thomas).
* **Country:** The country of the customer (using both full names and two-letter abbreviations like "FRA" for France).
* **Date:** The date of the transaction (in various formats, including MM-DD-YYYY and YYYY/MM/DD).
* **Product/Code:** A product name followed by a code (e.g., Eta/fzflrq).
* **Sales:** The sales amount in USD.
* **Cost:** The cost amount in USD.

The table shows 14 rows of data, each representing a different transaction.  The data suggests sales and cost figures for various products sold to different customers in different countries.  The "TransactionID" column seems to be sequentially numbered, suggesting a chronological or ordered list of transactions.  Row 0004 is highlighted in a pale yellow.

* **Country:** The country associated with the customer (e.g., IND, US, United Kingdom).  Note that some entries use abbreviations (e.g., IND for India, AE for the United Arab Emirates), and others use full names.
* **Date:** The date of the transaction (formatted inconsistently - some use MM-DD-YYYY, others YYYY/MM/DD).
* **Product/Code:** The product sold, identified by a name and a code (e.g., Delta/tbakf3).
* **Sales:** The amount of money made from the sale in USD.
* **Cost:** The cost of goods sold in USD.

The table lists 17 transactions, each with its unique details.  The data suggests international sales, with customers from various countries like India, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the UAE.  The product codes suggest different product lines (Alpha, Beta, Delta, etc.).  The sales and cost figures allow for calculating profit margins for each transaction.

**Image Description:** The image shows a computer screen displaying a coding or data entry exercise.  The main focus is a question: "What is the JSON data?".  Below this, a text box contains a JSON object with four key-value pairs:

* `"id"`: `"tt30422937"`
* `"title"`: `"6. Nadaaniyan"`
* `"year"`: `"2025"`
* `"rating"`: `"30"`

Below the JSON data, there's an error message:  `Error: At [1][title] Values don't match. Expected: "6. Naadaniyaan". Actual: "6. Nadaaniyan"`. This indicates a discrepancy between the provided title and an expected title, differing only slightly in spelling.

Further down, there's a message explaining that IMDb search results can vary by region and may require manual translation.  It also suggests that results change periodically, necessitating rerunning the scraper code. Finally, there is a button labeled "Check".

In short, the image depicts a debugging process related to retrieving and parsing JSON data from a source like IMDb, highlighting a title mismatch issue possibly caused by regional variations or data inconsistencies.

**Image Description:** The image shows a portion of a screen displaying what appears to be a movie or TV show listing, likely from a streaming service or similar platform.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Section:** This section contains a brief synopsis: "An FBI agent and Florida State officer team up to investigate a string of unsolved murder cases."  This is clearly a description of a different film or show than the ones listed below.


* **Middle Section (Main Focus):** This section focuses on a film titled "Nadaaniyan."  The following details are provided:

    * **Number:** 6. (indicating its position in a list)
    * **Title:** Nadaaniyan
    * **Year:** 2025
    * **Runtime:** 1h 59m
    * **Rating:** TV-14 (suggests a mature audience rating)
    * **User Rating:** 3.0 (14K) (a 3.0-star rating with 14,000 votes)
    * **Rate Button:**  A "Rate" button is visible, suggesting user interaction is possible.
    * **Image:** A movie poster thumbnail is present, showing two young people in what seems to be a romantic comedy setting.
    * **Synopsis:** A short description is given: "A privileged Delhi socialite hires a middle-class student to pose as her boyfriend to maintain her social status. Their pretense becomes complicated when genuine feelings develop between them."

* **Bottom Section (Partial View):** A portion of the next listing is visible, indicating the title "7. Watson" and a small thumbnail of a person's face. This suggests there are more entries in the list.

* **Other Elements:** Small arrow icons are visible to the left, likely indicating ways to expand or collapse sections. A small information icon is visible at the top right of the "Nadaaniyan" entry, which might provide further details if clicked.


In summary, the image provides information about the movie "Nadaaniyan," including its title, release year, runtime, rating, user reviews, a synopsis, and a poster image. It also shows a snippet of another movie listing, "Watson". The top section is unrelated to the listed movies.

## Post #100 by Saransh_Saini (Post ID: 611318)
Hi 
@23f2003751


Short Answer: No


Long Answer:


Backslashes are usually not a problem when converting a string to JSON. But somehow the evaluation script isn‚Äôt taking this into consideration. Check this out.

This is my response


image
1113√ó125 3.01 KB


which is shown incorrect just after adding 2 backslashes

1107√ó122 4.01 KB


Note: It would be better to check your responses on the TDS portal before finalising the script. You can access the answer box and check button by removing the disable attribute.

**Image Description:** The image shows a code editor or similar interface displaying a correctly sorted JSON array.

At the top, the text "Sorted JSON:" indicates the purpose of the displayed content.  The main part shows a JSON array containing three objects, each representing a person with a name and age:

* `{"name": "Bob", "age": 11}`
* `{"name": "Emma", "age": 11}`
* `{"name": "Grace", "age": 14}`

These objects are separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets `[]`.  The array is sorted alphabetically by name. There's also a final element `{ "na` which is incomplete and seemingly not part of the sorted data, likely a placeholder or residual text.  A green checkmark to its right indicates its validation status, possibly in a context of a coding exercise or validation.

At the bottom, the word "Correct" confirms that the JSON array is valid and properly formatted.  The overall dark theme, text color, and layout suggest a code editor or an online coding platform environment.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/d/cdf8c41b7c8b7001a3a4b48a1c77d8cfdfc0f6d0.png)

**Image Description:** The image displays a code snippet and a syntax error message.

The top section shows the text "Sorted JSON:" followed by a highlighted JSON array.  This array contains three JSON objects, each representing a person with a name and age:

* `{"name": "Bob", "age": 11}`
* `{"name": "Emma", "age": 11}`
* `{"name": "Grace", "age": 14}`

The array is incomplete, ending abruptly with an extra opening curly brace `{`, a double quote `"`, and a red warning symbol (an exclamation mark inside a circle). This indicates a syntax error.


The bottom section displays a syntax error message: "SyntaxError: Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 16 (line 1 column 17)".  This message means the JSON parser encountered an unexpected character at position 16 (the `"` character after the last closing curly brace `}`) on line 1, column 17 of the JSON code. This suggests that the JSON is improperly formatted.

@Saransh_Saini


it can‚Äôt be fixed actually, you would need the answer in the json format

but if the actual_answer needs to be string and if it happens to be of json type, it has to be represented using

As per the 19th March session, it was mentioned that the files would be the same for everyone, and only the parameters in the questions would vary. However, I have noticed that the files can actually be different. To support this, I‚Äôm attaching screenshots of the CSV files for GA5 Q1‚Äîone is mine, and the other belongs to a batchmate.

During the session, it was said that uploading files would take time, and the suggested solution was to pre-download the files on the server since they are supposed to be the same. But since the files are not identical for all students, this issue needs to be addressed.






The file is just 341kb. it should take less than a second. So you do not have to pre download this file. Only very large ones that are not parameterised you can have a hard copy of.

In 
GA4 Q2
, my task is to retrieve movie information from IMDb for all films with a rating between 3 and 5. I am scraping the correct movie names(for example 6th movie in given image), but the portal is accepting them differently. All movie names are provided in English, but the portal seems to be accepting some titles in other languages‚ÄîSpanish, Dutch, I believe.






Questions that require manual intervention will be graded very liberally. In other words those questions will not have as strict a grading criteria as in the GA portal.

In 
GA4 Q10
, very few students were able to solve the question using LLMs or Python during the assignment. Most of us ended up solving it manually. At that time, 
@carlton

How should we handle this question now?

**Image Description:** The image contains a spreadsheet-like table showing sales data.  The columns are clearly labeled:

* **TransactionID:** A numerical ID for each transaction (0001-0014).
* **Customer Name:** The name of the customer involved in each transaction.  Names include John Doe, Frank Thomas, Bob Brown, Charlie Davis, Alice Johnson, and Eve Wilson.
* **Country:** The country of the customer, using both full names (United States, United Kingdom) and two-letter country codes (FRA for France, IND for India, AE for United Arab Emirates, US for the United States).
* **Date:** The date of each transaction in various formats (MM-DD-YYYY, YYYY/MM/DD).
* **Product/Code:**  A product name followed by an alphanumeric code.
* **Sales:** The sales amount in USD for each transaction.
* **Cost:** The cost amount in USD for each transaction.


The table is likely a record of sales transactions, showing the customer, location, product, date, sales revenue, and cost associated with each transaction. The data appears to be from a business or accounting system.  Note the inconsistency in date formatting (MM-DD-YYYY vs YYYY/MM/DD).  There is also a slight highlight in yellow on row 4 of the table.

**Image Description:** The image contains a table of data, seemingly a sales report or transaction log.  The columns are clearly labeled:

* **TransactionID:** A unique numerical identifier for each transaction (e.g., 0001, 0002).
* **Customer Name:** The name of the customer involved in the transaction.
* **Country:** The country associated with the customer.  Abbreviations are used (e.g., IND for India, US for United States, AE for United Arab Emirates, UK for United Kingdom, Fra for France, Bra for Brazil).
* **Date:** The date of the transaction in various formats (e.g., MM-DD-YYYY, YYYY/MM/DD).
* **Product/Code:** The product sold, identified by a name and alphanumeric code (e.g., Delta/tbakf3).
* **Sales:** The sales amount in USD.
* **Cost:** The cost amount in USD.

The table contains 17 rows of data, each representing a different transaction.  The data appears to be consistent in format and structure, allowing for easy analysis or querying.  The information provided could be used to analyze sales performance by customer, product, country, or date.

**Image Description:** The image contains a Google Colab code snippet designed to generate a 5-character string based on a user's email and Google credentials.

Here's a breakdown of the content:

**1. Header:**  The header indicates the purpose of the code: to verify access to Google Colab and obtain a unique 5-character string.  It also reveals an email ID: `23f1001524@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.

**2. Code:** The Python code uses several libraries:
    * `hashlib`: For hashing algorithms (specifically SHA256 in this case).
    * `requests`: For making HTTP requests.
    * `google.colab.auth`: For authentication with Google Colab.
    * `oauth2client.client`: For OAuth 2.0 client credentials.

The code performs the following steps:
    * Authenticates the user using `auth.authenticate_user()`.
    * Obtains the default application credentials.
    * Retrieves an access token.
    * Makes an API call to `https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo` to get user information (including the email address).
    * Extracts the email address from the JSON response.
    * Concatenates the email and the token expiry year.
    * Hashes the resulting string using SHA256.
    * Extracts the last 5 characters of the hexadecimal digest.

**3. Output Question:** The question "What is the result? (It should be a 5-character string)" indicates that the code is meant to produce a 5-character string as its final output.  The output itself is not visible in the image (it's likely hidden because it would reveal sensitive information).

**In summary:** The image shows a self-contained code snippet that leverages Google's authentication system to generate a unique, albeit obfuscated, 5-character string based on user information and token expiry data, with the result intentionally obscured.  The code is designed to run within a Google Colab environment.

**Image Description:** The image contains a JSON-like formatted text that appears to be a step analysis report.  The report is broken down into sections:

**1. Introduction:** This section explains the purpose of the analysis‚Äîto examine the number of steps walked daily over a week and compare the results over time.  It details the data collection method (a fitness tracker) and mentions comparing steps with friends to analyze trends.

**2. Data Table (Implicit):**  A table is implied by the text showing steps walked for each day of the week:  Thursday (10,000), Friday (9,600), Monday (8,500), and a partial entry for Saturday.

**3. Code for Step Analysis:** This section shows a snippet of Python code using the pandas library (`pd.DataFrame`) to analyze the step data.  The code suggests the data was stored in a variable named `data`.  The `.describe()` method is used, which is a common function for generating descriptive statistics.

**4. Observations:** This section presents key findings.  It notes the highest step count was recorded on Sunday. It also includes observations from comparing step counts with friends (Alice and Bob, with their average steps per day given).

**5. Improvements:** This section provides suggestions to enhance step count tracking, such as increasing daily goals and using a more advanced fitness tracker.  It also links to an external webpage (`https://www.healthline.com/health/how-many-steps-a-day`) that may offer further information.

**6. Visualization (Mentioned but Not Shown):**  The report mentions a visualization section, but no visual elements are present in the image.


In short, the image shows a written report summarizing a step-counting analysis using Python for data processing.  Key data points include daily step counts and comparisons between individuals.

Questions Requiring Clarification/Manual Intervention for Evaluation (As Discussed in Tuesday‚Äôs Session)


Respected TDS Team,


As per the discussion during the Tuesday session, and following 
@Saransh
‚Äôs suggestion, I am creating this post to list the questions that may require manual intervention or are facing issues potentially due to portal-side behavior. Kindly verify these points before evaluation.




 Questions Requiring Manual Intervention / Portal-Side Issue






GA3 Q8




Issue: The question doesn‚Äôt mention all required queries. Although all mentioned queries were added, the portal seems to check for additional queries not stated, resulting in an incorrect answer flag.








GA3 Q9




Issue: This question asks to create an LLM prompt, but upon submission, a pop-up requests the AIPROXY_TOKEN.


Clarification needed: How are we supposed to handle token-based inputs for evaluation?








GA4 Q2 & Q10




Issue: Previously encountered issues have been resolved.


Reference: 
GA4 Q2 and Q10 resolution








Output Formatting (Multiple Questions)




Issue: When using plain text, the answer is accepted. However, in JSON format, newline characters (\n) and backslashes are added.


Note: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {‚Äúanswer‚Äù: ‚Äúresult‚Äù}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal.








Vercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment Questions




Issue: Some deployment-related questions require a **live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok.


Clarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated?










Deployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday‚Äôs Session)


Please include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues:






Platform Capability for GA Tasks




Which cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably?


Note: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage.








File Upload Example via Platform API




Request: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app.


This would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input.








General Observations on GA1-5

Output Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine. However, about 20% either have portal-side issues or deployment-related problems.








Kindly review these points before final evaluation, and let us know if any additional clarification is required from our side.

@Jivraj
 , is it possible to extend the deadline by 2 days April 1st, since we can use the LLM api a little more and Most people(me atleast) have Their OPPEs and its combined syllabus (and the OPPE 1 did not go well, partly due to my inadequacies) , which has much more to cover, since this project involves more involved coding compared to the last project(ideally project one should have taken not more than a day , still messed it up though xD). Asking for extension for 2 days, if possible. Really need it not even want, like 
need


Summary: Please extend Project 2 deadline by 2 days(April 1st),


(actually 1 day extension is April 1st)

## Post #111 by Saransh_Saini (Post ID: 611633)
Hi 
@23f1002382
 ,

Unfortunately it‚Äôs not possible for us to extend the deadline. Project 2 was released almost a month back, and that can be considered ample amount of time to complete the project. I can understand it must be hard to deal with it along with an upcoming OPPE, but this is what it is. Even if you are not able to cover all the 58 questions, try to cover the majority of them, as the evaluation involves sending just 1-3 questions for evals.


All the best for your OPPE and your Project 2

 "answer": "[{\"name\":\"Charlie\",\"age\":16},{\"name\":\"Liam\",\"age\":23},{\"name\":\"Bob\",\"age\":28},{\"name\":\"Grace\",\"age\":36},{\"name\":\"Ivy\",\"age\":44},{\"name\":\"Jack\",\"age\":53},{\"name\":\"David\",\"age\":56},{\"name\":\"Oscar\",\"age\":57},{\"name\":\"Karen\",\"age\":65},{\"name\":\"Frank\",\"age\":67},{\"name\":\"Nora\",\"age\":68},{\"name\":\"Emma\",\"age\":70},{\"name\":\"Paul\",\"age\":88},{\"name\":\"Alice\",\"age\":92},{\"name\":\"Henry\",\"age\":94},{\"name\":\"Mary\",\"age\":97}]"

Yes, it will. Just make sure that doing a json.loads() on this string should give you the desired output.

The GA portal marks it as wrong unless I manually insert new lines. I hope that won‚Äôt be an issue, will it?

Your markdown must have newline characters or spaces wherever necessary. Otherwise we will not be able to check if your answer is correct. Our parser will only work if encodings for the formatting are present in the response. If there are no encodings (invisible or visible) then we will not have the correctly formatted file.


Please review module 1 for a better understanding about how text is encoded. Especially invisible characters.


The browser is designed for user friendliness. Thats why the characters are invisible when you copy paste string with newlines. But it exists.


The programmatic strings show invisible encodings as escaped characters. (Usually)


To check if a string has invisible characters,


# Multi-line string
my_string = """Hello
World    with    spaces 
and some newlines
and a tab	"""

# Print ASCII values of each character
print([ord(c) for c in my_string])



e.g., newline = 10, tab = 9


This is a great way to check what we are receiving when you send us some response,


import requests
import json

# This is just an example server to see what we see.

url = "https://httpbin.org/post"

my_multiline_string_answer = """This is a multiline
string that spans
multiple lines    with    spaces 
and some newlines
and a tab	as well."""

response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = {
"answer": my_multiline_string_answer
}

# Send the JSON data
response = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator)

# Check the response
print (response.status_code)
print (response.json ())
print (response.text)

# Do other checks as necessary... 



See what happens when I print the result


print (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer'])

Its a proper multiline correctly formatted text! The encodings are invisible just like in the original as well as in your clipboard when you copy paste into the GA.


Here is a json example:


json_answer = {
    "mary": "poppins",
    "age": 42
}

stringed_json = json.dumps (json_answer)
response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = {
"answer": stringed_json
}

response = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator)

print (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer'])



Look at the response. A perfect json.




If you do not want spaces in the response then strip the spaces before you send the stringified response.


Kind regards

**Image Description:** The image shows a terminal window displaying a Python file named `test.py`.  The file contains a multiline string literal demonstrating the use of spaces, newlines, and a tab character within the string.  The terminal's prompt shows the username `venvcarland` on a machine named `Carlton-MacBook-Pro`. The current directory is `/Users/venvcarland/tds`.

**Image Description:** The image shows a terminal session.  The user, `venvcarland`, is working on a MacBook Pro.  The current directory is `tds`. The user executes `tds/test.py`, which appears to be a Python script.  The output of the script is a Python dictionary: `{"mary": "poppins", "age": 42}`.  This suggests the script is likely creating or printing a simple dictionary containing information about someone named Mary Poppins, who is 42 years old.  Both before and after the execution of the script, the terminal prompt shows the same user and directory.

I would request the TDS team to please consider making the evaluation criteria for project 2 a bit more liberal.

5 random Questions with 4 marks each is quite harsh. I request you to make it more balanced like 2 Qs from each GA with 2 marks each or so. So that even if we can‚Äôt exhaustively cover the whole number of questions, it gives mercy for the partial completion.


5 random question is a kind of lottery or luck based unless our app is perfect. Thanks

GA2 - Question 3: Publish a Page Using GitHub Pages








As part of the requirement, I successfully published a webpage using GitHub Pages that includes my email address 
21f3001076@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
 in the HTML content. The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system.






To automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page‚Äôs availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10‚Äì20 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process‚Äîfrom initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live‚Äîtakes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine.






However, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly‚Äîbefore the GitHub Pages site is actually live‚Äîresulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a 
502 Bad Gateway
 error, likely due to Azure‚Äôs request timeout limitations. The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform‚Äôs allowed response duration.








GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files








A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a 
502 Bad Gateway
 error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure‚Äôs execution time limit.






Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.






Currently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably. Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point. I am not certain if alternative platforms will work consistently across all questions, and making such a change could introduce failures in other parts of the assignment where Azure performs well.


Below Image is showing response of local machine api request for GA2 Q3 which works fine.

**Image Description:** The image shows a split screen.  The left side displays a network request and response, likely from a developer tool like the browser's developer console.  Key elements include:

* **Request URL:** `http://337.x.x.x:8000/api/`  This indicates a request to an API endpoint at a specific IP address.  The `x.x.x` suggests IP address redaction for privacy.

* **Server response (Code):** `200` - A status code indicating a successful request.

* **Response body:**  A JSON object with a single key-value pair: `"answer": "https://2113001076.github.io/github-pages-20230327144836/"`. This is a GitHub Pages URL.  A `Download` button is available next to it.

* **Response Headers:**  A section showing various HTTP headers returned by the server (access-control-allow-credentials, content-type, date, server).  These headers provide metadata about the response.


The right side shows a tutorial or lesson related to GitHub Pages. The text explains that GitHub Pages uses Cloudflare, which obscures email addresses in URLs.  The core part shows:

* **An example of an obfuscated URL:**  A partially redacted URL where email address is replaced with placeholders (the `email_off` part is visible).

* **A question and its answer:** The task is to identify the correct GitHub Pages URL format. The correct answer is provided (`https://2113001076.github.io/github-pages-20230327144836/`), marked with a green checkmark. This matches the URL found in the response body on the left.

* **A note about caching:**  Instructions are given on how to bypass the cache if changes aren't immediately reflected.

In short, the image demonstrates a practical example of interacting with a GitHub Pages site and highlights how Cloudflare's email obfuscation and caching mechanisms can affect the URLs.  The left panel shows the raw network details, while the right panel provides context and instructions for understanding and working with those details.

Final Thoughts on Project 2


Project 2 has been a valuable yet challenging experience. I‚Äôd like to share a few reflections‚Äînot as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations.




Organization & Structure:

The project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I‚Äôm not blaming anyone‚Äîjust sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback.


Deployment & Portal Limitations:

There are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning.


Time Constraints:

Balancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments.


Sessions & Support:

The sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward.


Deployment Variability:

Each GA‚Äôs questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably.


Effort Acknowledgment:

I sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors‚Äîit‚Äôs clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it‚Äôs also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail‚Äîeven the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment.


Feasibility in the Given Timeline:

Even for someone with a technical background, it‚Äôs difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn‚Äôt always feasible before the deadline.






I genuinely hope someone is able to complete 
all 57 questions
 successfully‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to learn from their experience and solutions.


Again, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know‚ÄîI‚Äôm happy to edit or delete the post if needed.


Thank you for the learning opportunity

Dear Sirs,


I have a question regarding Q3 and Q4 of GA5. When calling the API, should we pass the 
.gz
 file directly, or will the API accept a Google Drive link from which it can download the 
.gz
 file?


Specifically, will the API call be structured as follows?


Essentialy, will the API call look like so?




curl -X POST ‚Äú
http://127.0.0.1:5000
‚Äù 

-H ‚ÄúContent-Type: multipart/form-data‚Äù 

-F "question=Bandwidth Analysis for Regional Contents - 
anand.net
 is a personal website that had region-specific music content. One of the site‚Äôs key sections is tamilmp3, which hosts music files and is especially popular among the local audience. The website is powered by robust Apache web servers that record detailed access logs. These logs are essential for understanding user behavior, server load, and content engagement. By analyzing the server‚Äôs Apache log file, the author can identify heavy users and take measures to manage bandwidth, improve site performance, or even investigate potential abuse. Your Task: This GZipped Apache log file has 258,074 rows. Each row is an Apache web log entry for the site 
s-anand.net
 in May 2024. Each row has these fields:


IP: The IP address of the visitor.

Remote logname: The remote logname of the visitor. Typically ‚Äò-‚Äô.

Remote user: The remote user of the visitor. Typically ‚Äò-‚Äô.

Time: The time of the visit. E.g. [01/May/2024:00:00:00 +0000]. Note that this is not quoted, and you need to handle this.

Request: The request made by the visitor. E.g. GET /blog/ HTTP/1.1. It has three space-separated parts:

(a) Method: The HTTP method. E.g. GET.

(b) URL: The URL visited. E.g. /blog/.

(c) Protocol: The HTTP protocol. E.g. HTTP/1.1.

Status: The HTTP status code. If 200 <= Status < 300, it is a successful request.

Size: The size of the response in bytes. E.g. 1234.

Referer: The referer URL. E.g. 
https://s-anand.net/
.

User agent: The browser used. This will contain spaces and might have escaped quotes.

Vhost: The virtual host. E.g. 
s-anand.net
.

Server: The IP address of the server.


The fields are separated by spaces and quoted by double quotes (‚Äò-‚Äô). Unlike CSV files, quoted fields are escaped via \" and not ‚Äò-‚Äô. (This impacts 41 rows.)


All data is in the GMT-0500 timezone, and the questions are based on this same timezone.


Filter the Log Entries: Extract only the requests where the URL starts with /tamilmp3/. Include only those requests made on the specified 2024-05-23.


Aggregate Data by IP: Sum the ‚ÄòSize‚Äô field for each unique IP address from the filtered entries.


Identify the Top Data Consumer: Determine the IP address that has the highest total downloaded bytes. Report the total number of bytes that this IP address downloaded.


Across all requests under tamilmp3/ on 2024-05-23, how many bytes did the top IP address (by volume of downloads) download?" 

-F ‚Äúfile=@s-anand.net-May-2024.gz‚Äù




I would appreciate your clarification on whether the 
.gz
 file should be directly included in the API request or if a Google Drive link should be provided instead.


Thank you for your time and assistance.

**Image Description:** The image contains a description of a data processing task involving a GZipped Apache log file.  Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**The Data:**

* **File:** A 61MB GZipped Apache log file containing 258,074 rows. Each row represents a single web log entry from the website `s-anand.net` in May 2024.
* **Fields:** Each row is structured with the following space-separated fields, enclosed in double quotes (`"`), with escaped quotes represented by `\"`:
    * `IP`: Visitor's IP address.
    * `Remote logname`: Remote logname (typically "-").
    * `Remote user`: Remote user (typically "-").
    * `Time`: Timestamp in the format `[DD/Mon/YYYY:HH:MM:SS +ZZZZ]`.  Crucially, this field is *not* quoted.
    * `Request`:  Three space-separated sub-fields:
        * `Method`: HTTP method (e.g., GET).
        * `URL`: The requested URL.
        * `Protocol`: HTTP protocol version (e.g., HTTP/1.1).
    * `Status`: HTTP status code (e.g., 200).
    * `Size`: Response size in bytes.
    * `Referer`: Referrer URL.
    * `User agent`: Browser information (may contain spaces and escaped quotes).
    * `Vhost`: Virtual host (e.g., `s-anand.net`).
    * `Server`: Server's IP address.
* **Timezone:** All data is in the GMT-0500 timezone.
* **Note:** 41 rows have quoted fields that use the escape character `\"`.


**The Task:**

The task is two-fold:

1. **Filtering:** Extract only the log entries that meet these criteria:
    * The URL in the `Request` field starts with `/malayalammp3/`.
    * The request was made on 2024-05-15 (date from the `Time` field).

2. **Aggregation:**  For the filtered data, calculate the sum of the `Size` field for each unique `IP` address.


In summary, the image presents a data analysis problem requiring the processing of a large Apache log file to filter and aggregate data based on specific criteria.  The detailed description of the file structure, field types, and the escape character used are crucial for correctly solving the task.

GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files






A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a 
502 Bad Gateway
 error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure‚Äôs execution time limit.


Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.








@carlton

I watched the last session. In that session, regarding the specific PDF question, you mentioned that the PDF is the same for everyone, so it can be preprocessed beforehand. However, I checked and found that the PDF is actually different for each user. So, we need to fetch it from the API endpoint.

How should we handle the timeout issue on the deployment platform? I even tried upgrading the plan, but it didn‚Äôt help.


@s.anand


@carlton
 
@Jivraj

Also, many questions and doubts were addressed in the last two sessions. I can improve a lot and add the remaining questions, but the constraint is the 31st March deadline. Most students, including myself, will only get time after 30th March due to Viva and OPPE.

It would be really helpful if the TDS team could extend the deadline.


I believe it would strike a good balance‚Äîteam made us wait for the Project 1 results, but extending the Project 2 deadline would make up for that for some extent. Its request nothing else.

Hi 
@lakshaygarg654
,

Yes for GA4_Q9 the PDF files are different for everyone, but the workflow is exactly the same. Its a basic tabula read, with no particular need of any preprocessing. So, yeah you have to fetch it from the API request.

Unfortunately, we can‚Äôt extend Project 2 deadline, it was released on 3rd of March, and we believe ample amount of time was given for it. If you are lagging far behind in the race, we would encourage you to collaborate with other and get the project done.

---

## Post #147 by 22f3002933 (Post ID: 612303)
Thanks for the answer sir.


I remember being told on the last session, that the question will be exactly the same we have on the assignment portal for my respective case, and the answer on the portal can be the same here as well.


Actually I am exploring a hardcoded answer route where if i return the answer which I already got after solving the questions on the portal (in certain qns with dynamic functions) , so thought of asking if method is alright.

---

## Post #148 by Saransh_Saini (Post ID: 612308)
Yes sending your GA answer as text as the JSON response can work if the question was not parameterized. I hope you are aware that parameters for some questions will be changed, resulting in different answers.

## Post #149 by lakshaygarg654 (Post ID: 612309)
Thanks for your reply

I‚Äôve figured out the solution to that particular question.

The deadline is still a concern, as many issues were only resolved during recent sessions‚Äîsimilar to the project 1 workflow‚Äîand This time there are many other things in the pipeline ( viva‚Äôs and oppe‚Äôs )

Anyway, I will complete this course with valuable learnings, but many others have been seriously affected by it.

It is given that only one file arguement is passed , can there be a usecase where multiple files are sent , for example GA-5 10th question Image reconstruction where there could be one file be the image another could be separate file with mapping, Although mapping can be given with question as well,

But still can you please confirm if there will be only one file or there can be multiple files send to API?

I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to work on this project. I have developed a mini chatbot backend using

, which handles question matching and execution internally, producing appropriate responses. 
My mini chatbot is capable of creating its own API using REST and can manage tasks such as image compression, repository management, workflows, and web scraping related to graded assignments. It can even calculate total marks for subjects like physics and convert PDFs into markdown content. Additionally, it is capable of downloading the Llama model and creating a tunnel using ngrok. Essentially, it can address the first four assignment questions.


However, there are some limitations to this project. Currently, it processes my local files instead of the uploaded PDFs. I am working on resolving this issue, but I have some confusion regarding the internal handling of uploaded files. When I pass a PDF or file through an upload method, how should the system proceed? I want to ensure that the file is treated as a PDF for the user rather than just being referenced as ‚Äúquestion.pdf.‚Äù How can I effectively manage this problem?


Furthermore, there is an issue with question matching. At times, the system incorrectly identifies questions containing the word ‚Äúcode‚Äù and executes 
first.py
 for GA1.


Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project!


Best regards,

I am bit confused about  answer evaluation process. Can you tell which one  is correct process.

1st process ( I used json.dumps() to get my_response as json formatted string)

2nd process ( This one is Json object)

514√ó193 3.61 KB


or both are incorrect?


This is one more example of 1st process after json.loads() it gave me correct format for assignment portal answer:

**Image Description:** The image contains a code snippet and its output.  The code is written in Python and uses the `json` library.

**Code Description:**

1. **`import json`**: This line imports the `json` library, which is necessary for working with JSON data in Python.

2. **`my_response = "{\"answer\": \"26272\"}"`**: This line defines a string variable named `my_response`.  This string contains a JSON object that has a single key-value pair: `"answer"` with a value of `"26272"`. Note the use of backslashes to escape the double quotes within the string.


3. **`print(json.loads(my_response)["answer"])`**: This line does the following:
   - `json.loads(my_response)`: This parses the JSON string `my_response` and converts it into a Python dictionary.
   - `["answer"]`: This accesses the value associated with the key `"answer"` in the resulting dictionary.
   - `print(...)`: This prints the value (which is "26272") to the console.

**Output:**

Below the code, the output of the code is displayed: `26272`. This confirms that the code successfully parsed the JSON string and extracted the value associated with the "answer" key.

In essence, this code demonstrates how to parse a JSON string in Python and extract specific data from it.  The play button suggests this might be part of an interactive coding tutorial or environment.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/8/4/848f46d75a3912b4ccc280a7594136401c0f0c36.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a snippet of Python code and its output.  Let's break down the elements:

* **`[14]`:** This likely indicates a line number or code block identifier within a larger program.

* **`import json`:** This line imports the `json` library, which is necessary for working with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data in Python.

* **`my_response = {"answer": "26272"}`:** This line creates a Python dictionary named `my_response`.  This dictionary contains a single key-value pair:  the key "answer" maps to the string value "26272".  This is a JSON-like structure.

* **`print(my_response["answer"])`:** This line prints the value associated with the key "answer" in the `my_response` dictionary.  It accesses the value using dictionary indexing.

* **`26272`:** This is the output of the `print()` function. It displays the value "26272" to the console, demonstrating that the code successfully retrieved and printed the value from the dictionary.

In short, the code snippet demonstrates a basic example of how to use the `json` library in Python to handle data in JSON format, specifically retrieving and printing a specific value from a JSON-like dictionary.  The number 26272 is the key piece of information extracted and displayed.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/e/ae62c221a5f66faaa47d8b10c00b733a7b617d64.png)

**Image Description:** The image contains a Python code snippet focusing on sentiment analysis using the OpenAI API.  Let's break down the key parts:

**1. Imports:**

* `import json`: This line imports the `json` library, essential for handling JSON data (a common data format for APIs).
* Implicit `import httpx`: The code uses `httpx.post`, implying the `httpx` library is also imported for making HTTP requests (likely to interact with the OpenAI API).

**2. API Interaction:**

* `my_response`: This variable will store the API's response.
* `url`: This string contains the API endpoint URL for OpenAI's chat completions (`https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`).
* `headers`: This dictionary sets HTTP headers for the request, including an authorization token ("Bearer dummy_api_key").  This is likely a placeholder; a real key is needed for functionality.
* `data`: This dictionary contains the request body, specifying the model to use (`gpt-40-mini`) and the messages to send to the API.  Crucially, a "system" message instructs the model to perform sentiment analysis and classify the input text as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL.  The "user" message contains the text "P5I 3P1xw aE WvYHB6zc5xB SY4QzV 0bM8tDP7e o MOG4R9" for sentiment analysis.
* `response = httpx.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)`: This line sends a POST request to the OpenAI API.
* `raise_for_status()`: This function (presumably from `httpx`) checks for HTTP errors in the response and raises an exception if any are encountered.
* `result = response.json()`: This parses the JSON response from the API.

**3. Sentiment Analysis Function:**

* `analyze_sentiment()`: This function encapsulates the API interaction.  It returns the parsed JSON result.

**4. Main Execution Block:**

* `if __name__ == "__main__":`: This standard Python idiom ensures the code within only runs when the script is executed directly (not imported as a module).
* `try...except`: This block handles potential exceptions during the API call.
* `print(sentiment_result)`: This prints the sentiment analysis result.
* `print(json.loads(my_response)["answer"])`: This line attempts to extract and print the "answer" field from `my_response`‚Äîthis is likely redundant and may not function correctly unless `my_response` is correctly formatted.

**In summary:**  The code sends text to OpenAI's API to determine its sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).  It then prints the result, demonstrating a basic sentiment analysis workflow.  However, the use of "dummy_api_key" highlights that it's a template and needs a real OpenAI API key to function properly.  The last `print` statement seems unnecessary given the existing `print` statement within the `try` block.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/8/f80d8908109db818e5664f5565bf0a6006055001.png)

**Image Description:** The image contains a Python code snippet.  The code defines a function `analyze_sentiment` that uses the OpenAI API to perform sentiment analysis on a given text. Let's break down the key parts:

* **`import json`**: Imports the `json` library for handling JSON data.
* **`my_response = { ... }`**: Defines a dictionary `my_response` where the key "answer" holds the core logic.
* **`analyze_sentiment()` function**: This function does the following:
    * **`import httpx`**: Imports the `httpx` library for making HTTP requests.
    * **`url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"`**: Sets the URL for the OpenAI API endpoint for chat completions.
    * **`headers = { ... }`**: Defines the HTTP headers, including an authorization header with a placeholder `"Bearer dummy_api_key"` (this should be replaced with a real API key).  It also sets the `Content-Type` to `application/json`.
    * **`data = { ... }`**: Defines the JSON payload for the API request. This includes:
        * `"model"`: Specifies the OpenAI model to use (`gpt-40-mini`).
        * `"messages"`: An array of messages.  The first message is a system message instructing the model to perform sentiment analysis and classify the sentiment as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. The second message contains the text to analyze, which appears to be a placeholder or encoded text (`"P513P1xw aE WvYHB6zc5xB SY4QzV 0bM8tDP7e o MOG4R9"`).
    * **`response = httpx.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)`**: Makes a POST request to the OpenAI API.
    * **`response.raise_for_status()`**: Raises an exception if the API request resulted in an error status code.
    * **`result = response.json()`**: Parses the JSON response from the API.
    * **`return result`**: Returns the parsed JSON response.

* **`if __name__ == "__main__":`**: This block executes only when the script is run directly (not imported as a module).
    * **`try...except`**: A `try...except` block to handle potential exceptions during the API call.
    * **`sentiment_result = analyze_sentiment()`**: Calls the `analyze_sentiment` function.
    * **`print(sentiment_result)`**: Prints the sentiment analysis result.
    * **`print(f"Error: {e}")`**: Prints an error message if an exception occurs.

* **`print(my_response["answer"])`**: This line is outside the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block and appears to be intended to print the "answer" key within the `my_response` dictionary; however, it's likely redundant given the placement within the code.  It is likely a leftover or a mistake.

In short, this code defines a function to send a sentiment analysis request to the OpenAI API and prints the result.  However, the API key is a placeholder and the text being analyzed is unusual.  The code likely needs adjustments for proper functionality and should use a secure method of storing the API key.

**Image Description:** The image shows a Microsoft Azure webpage related to academic verification.  The top banner displays "Microsoft Azure" on the left and a user's email address, "23/2004705@ds.study.itm.ac.in," along with a "Sign out" option on the right.

A blue banner below indicates that the user's email domain is not registered with Microsoft. It offers the option to choose a different verification method.

The main body of the page is titled "Academic Verification" and provides instructions for verifying a user's academic status. These instructions involve:

* Entering the name as it appears in school records.
* Selecting the school's country.
* Entering the school's name.
* Entering the date of birth as it appears in school records.
* Providing a school-provided email address (emphasized as necessary for contact in case of verification issues).

The overall context suggests that the user is attempting to verify their academic credentials through Microsoft Azure, likely for access to a student program or resource.  The error message about the email domain indicates that a school-issued email address is required for this process.

A banner at the very top states "Your email domain is not currently registered with us. You can choose another verification method."

* **Instructions:**  Clear instructions are provided on how to fill out the form.  The user is asked to enter their name, date of birth, and school information as it appears in school records. It emphasizes that a school-provided email address should be used for contact.

* **Fields:** The form contains several input fields:
    * **First name:**  "shashikumar" is already partially filled in.
    * **Last name:** This field is empty, with a red "This field is required" message displayed below.
    * **Country:** A dropdown menu with "India" selected is visible.  A note indicates that if the country is not listed, the offer is not available. A "Learn More" hyperlink is provided.
    * **School name:** The field contains "Indian Institute Of Technology Madras (Chennai, Tamil Nadu)". Below this field is a further explanation of its purpose.
    * **Date of birth:** This field is empty.

* **Overall:** The form appears to be part of a larger online application or registration process, likely requiring verification of student identity and affiliation with a recognized institution.

In both the scenarios you laid out, the second implementation is correct. Your response to our API request should be a JSON object

}



Q3 - Host your portfolio on GitHub Pages, Q7 - Create a GitHub action, Q8 - Push an Image to Docker Hub: Similar to GA1 Q13, these too have my email or roll number as parameter. These too 
WILL NOT
 be checked against any other email, right?


GA3:


Can you please give an example of how questions of this GA will be sent in the request, especially any of Q1 or Q2 or Q5 or Q6 or Q7 or Q8 which have code-blocks containing text crucial to the question? I just want to decide whether regex or function-calling would be more appropriate here.


GA4:


The links to the website are hyperlinks in the questions. When the question will be sent to my app, will the link of the website to be scraped be written as a full link in the question itself or will it be sent in some other way?

What Jivraj agreed was stringifying the answer and putting it in as the value of the

Just check the Project 2 page on the portal. It‚Äôs clearly mentioned a JSON object has to sent not a strigified version of the entire JSON object.

We will take Q1 in this format, which is just copy pasting from portal```

One of the test cases involves sending a sample piece of meaningless text:


au7BK3 33 H 5   lKz6y4n  oQmbgoX 0  hNW3JH  68Q1u



Write a Python program that uses 
httpx
 to send a POST request to OpenAI‚Äôs API to analyze the sentiment of this (meaningless) text into GOOD, BAD or NEUTRAL. Specifically:




Make sure you pass an Authorization header with dummy API key.


Use 
gpt-4o-mini
 as the model.


The first message must be a system message asking the LLM to analyze the sentiment of the text. Make sure you mention GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL as the categories.


The second message must be 
exactly
 the text contained above.




This test is crucial for DataSentinel Inc. as it validates both the API integration and the correctness of message formatting in a controlled environment. Once verified, the same mechanism will be used to process genuine customer feedback, ensuring that the sentiment analysis module reliably categorizes data as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. This reliability is essential for maintaining high operational standards and swift response times in real-world applications.


Note
: This uses a dummy 
httpx
 library, not the real one. You can only use:




response = httpx.get(url, **kwargs)


response = httpx.post(url, json=None, **kwargs)


response.raise_for_status()


response.json()

As per the portal, we have to return a JSON object as a response from the API. However, if we load a JSON object directly using 
json.load()
, it will throw an error. We need to first convert it into a JSON string and then load it using 
json.loads( )
. For clarity I add image below.


This question has been stretched for too long‚Äîit‚Äôs not that big.


I guess 
@Jivraj
 is right.

**Image Description:** This image shows a Jupyter Notebook code cell and its output, illustrating a common error when working with JSON data in Python.

**Top Section (Error):**

The top section displays Python code that attempts to parse a JSON object.  The code is:

```python
import json
my_response = {
  "answer": "26272"
}
print(json.loads(my_response)["answer"])
```

This code defines a dictionary `my_response` which is in JSON format. It then tries to load this dictionary directly using `json.loads()`.  This fails because `json.loads()` expects a string, bytes, or bytearray representation of the JSON data, not a Python dictionary.

The output shows a `TypeError`: "the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray," along with a traceback indicating the line where the error occurred (line 6). The traceback also shows the location of the error within the `json` library's source code ( `/usr/lib/python3.11/json/__init__.py`).  Line numbers 337-341 in `json/__init__.py` show the part of the `json.loads()` function that raises the `TypeError`.

**Bottom Section (Solution):**

The bottom section provides a corrected version of the code:

```python
import json
my_response = {
  "answer": "26272"
}
#converting json object to string as "{\"answer\": \"26272\""
my_response = json.dumps(my_response)
print(json.loads(my_response)["answer"])
```

Here, `json.dumps()` converts the Python dictionary `my_response` into a JSON string representation.  This string is then correctly parsed by `json.loads()`, resulting in the correct output: `26272`.


In short, the image demonstrates the crucial difference between a Python dictionary and its JSON string representation and how to correctly use `json.dumps()` and `json.loads()` to convert between them.

**Image Description:** This image presents a coding challenge or assignment.  Here's a breakdown of the content:

**The Task:**

The task is to extract movie data from IMDb and format it into a JSON structure.  The steps are outlined:

1. **Source:** Use IMDb's advanced web search (`https://www.imdb.com/search/title/`) to access movie data.

2. **Filter:** Filter results to include only movies with ratings between 2 and 8.

3. **Format:**  Extract the movie ID, title, year, and rating for up to the first 25 movies. The movie ID is the part of the URL following "tt" within the `<a href>` attribute. The example `tt10078772` shows the ID format. The data should be organized in a JSON array of objects, with each object having the keys "id", "title", "year", and "rating".  A partial example of the required JSON structure is provided.

4. **Submit:** Submit the generated JSON data into a text box (not shown in the image).

**Key Features:**

* **IMDb URL:**  The URL `https://www.imdb.com/search/title/` is crucial; it's where the data needs to be sourced from.
* **ID Format:** The example `tt10078772` illustrates how to identify movie IDs within IMDb's HTML.
* **JSON Structure Example:** The image provides a sample JSON structure showing the expected format of the output data, including the keys and data types.  The `// ... more titles` comment indicates the JSON array should contain more movie objects based on the filtering and extraction done.
* **Rating Range:** The range of movie ratings to include is specified as 2 to 8, inclusive.
* **Maximum Titles:** The maximum number of movie titles to extract is 25.


The image is essentially a structured prompt for a programming task involving web scraping and JSON data manipulation.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/e/0/e010f5c327843dec9c8f355ca5bc35830300c3f8_2_690x189.jpeg)

**Image Description:** This image shows a segment of Javascript code.  The code appears to be designed to retrieve and parse data from IMDb, likely using a proxy server.

Here's a breakdown of the key features:

* **Data Retrieval:** The code first fetches data from an IMDb search URL using `fetch()`.  The URL dynamically incorporates a user rating (`user_rating=${r}.${n}`) suggesting the code is designed to fetch information based on a rating. The use of a proxy (`/proxy/https://www.imdb.com...`) is notable, possibly for security or rate-limiting purposes.

* **Error Handling:** It includes error handling using a `try...catch` block.  If the fetch request fails (`!h.ok`), an error is thrown with a message indicating the failure and including the HTTP status code and status text from the response.

* **DOM Parsing:** The code parses the HTML response using `DOMParser()` to extract specific information.

* **Data Extraction:**  The code uses `querySelectorAll()` to select specific elements within the parsed HTML, focusing on elements with classes such as:
    * `.ipc-title-link-wrapper`: Likely containing the IMDb ID.  The code uses `getAttribute("href")` and a regular expression to extract the ID.
    * `.ipc-title__text`: Likely containing the title of the movie or show.
    * `.dli-title-metadata-item`: Likely containing the year.
    * `.ipc-rating-star-rating`: Likely containing the rating.

* **Data Structure:** The extracted data is then structured into a Javascript object with the following keys: `id`, `title`, `year`, `rating`.

* **Variables:** The code uses numerous variables (e.g., `r`, `n`, `s`, `h`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `w`, `l`). Their exact meaning is not fully clear without more context, but they appear to represent intermediate values during data processing.  The presence of `l = Array(25)` suggests that an array of 25 elements might be used at some later point in the code.

* **`map()` Function:** The code uses the `.map()` function to transform the node list obtained from `querySelectorAll()` into an array of objects, each representing a single movie or show's data.


In summary, this code snippet represents a function designed to fetch and parse data about movies or shows from IMDb based on a user-specified rating, returning a structured JSON-like object with information about the items found. The use of a proxy suggests an attempt to avoid issues with direct access.

 I just wanted to bring to your attention that in GA4 question 2, the answer evaluation script expects the movie title as ‚Äú17. Kraven: The Hunter‚Äù but it is actually listed on the IMDb page as ‚Äú17. Kraven the Hunter‚Äù, resulting in the correct one being marked wrong.

No questions here just wanted to bring it to attention so that it does not affect the project evaluation script.

Its unusual to have a docker container worth 7 GBs of space. Here is what you can do




Remove unused libraries from your 
requirements.txt
. Sometimes having resource demanding libraries like 
SentenceTransformers
 can install large sub-dependency packages.


Exclude your virtual environment folder from the container creation


Create a 
.containerignore
 file to have an exception for those folders you want to skip.


Clear your package cache and any vscode cache you might have.

In the previous replies, you‚Äôve mentioned that for Github questions ‚Üí actions, pages (GA2) that if the email changes for everyone it means that its parameterised. However, in one of the live sessions this week, Carlton had mentioned that for these questions, it wont be parameterised as this is very individual specific. The same goes for the docker hub question of GA2 as well. KIndly clarify on the same.


For GA2 Q9 ‚Üí I have given an input file via post request and my fastapi server can handle get requests and its as follows. Kindly confirm if my url is good to go for this specific question.

**Image Description:** This image shows a screenshot of an API testing tool, likely Postman or a similar application.  The interface is designed to send POST requests to a specific API endpoint.

Here's a breakdown of the key content:

* **Top Section:** This section indicates the HTTP method (`POST`) and the API endpoint (`/api`).  It also states the API's purpose: to accept a CSV file and return student data, optionally filtering by class.  A URL illustrating optional query parameters is given (`?class=1A&class=1B`).

* **Parameters Section:** This section allows the user to define query parameters for the request.  There's a field for `Name` (parameter name) and `Description`.  Two example parameters are already populated: `class` with value `1A` and another `class` with value `1B`. There are options to add more parameters and a "Add string item" button suggesting this is a parameter that accepts an array of strings.

* **Request Body Section:**  This section is for specifying the data sent in the body of the POST request.  It's explicitly set to `multipart/form-data`, indicating that a file upload is expected.  There's a "Choose file" button to select a CSV file. The `file` parameter is marked as `required`.

* **Execute and Clear Buttons:** These buttons trigger the API call and clear the response area, respectively. A progress bar appears while the request is executed.

* **Responses Section:** This shows the results of the API call.

    * **Curl Command:** A cURL command is displayed, showing how to replicate the request using the command line tool. This includes the URL, headers (accepting JSON, content-type being `multipart/form-data`), and the file to upload.
    * **Request URL:**  The full URL used in the request is shown. Note a slight discrepancy between the curl command URL and the Request URL, likely a reflection of using a testing environment/proxy.
    * **Server Response:**  The HTTP status code (`200`) indicates success.
    * **Response Body:** The JSON response is displayed, showing a list of students with `studentId` and `class` attributes.

In short, the image documents a successful API test where a CSV file was uploaded, and the server returned student data as JSON. The `class` parameter was used to filter the results (although, in this example, the student data shows class '1A' despite filtering for '1A' and '1B'). The screenshot provides a complete record of the request and response for debugging or documentation purposes.

Sir, in GA4 Question 7, the portal gives the boundary of ultra-new user as the exact time when it was opened, right?


image
1602√ó275 34.1 KB

So, will this boundary for ultra-new user be sent as parameter in the question or can my app use datetime.now() to set the ultra-new user boundary?

**Image Description:** This image shows a text-based interface, possibly a code snippet or instructions for a program related to data analysis or talent acquisition on GitHub.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Section:** This section outlines three key areas:  "Competitive Intelligence," "Efficiency," and "Data-Driven Decisions."  Each point describes a benefit or goal, likely related to recruitment or talent acquisition within the tech industry.  The focus is on using data to improve strategies.

* **Middle Section:** A blank text input field is labeled "Enter the date (ISO 8601, e.g. '2024-01-01T00:00:00Z') when the newest user joined GitHub." This suggests the user needs to input a specific date in ISO 8601 format.

* **Bottom Section:** Instructions are provided for a search query, likely within a database or API.¬† The instructions involve filtering by `location` and `followers`, sorting by the `joined` date in descending order, fetching the first URL result and entering the `created_at` field.  It also specifies to ignore users who joined very recently (after a certain date).¬†The date and time "3/30/2025, 7:21:18 PM" seems to be a timestamp indicating when these instructions were last accessed or the query was last run.


In short, the image provides instructions for extracting and analyzing data from GitHub, potentially to track user growth, identify relevant users based on location and followers, and inform business decisions in recruitment. The focus is on automating data collection and using data-driven strategies.

**Image Description:** The image is a digital painting or rendering of a futuristic cityscape at night.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Architecture:** The city is densely packed with tall, sleek skyscrapers, many with glowing neon accents of pink and blue. The buildings have a distinct, almost organic, geometric design, with curves and sharp angles combined.  Several buildings have dome-like structures at their tops. The overall architectural style suggests advanced technology and a high level of density.

* **Transportation:** Elevated highways and roadways crisscross the city, with streaks of light suggesting fast-moving vehicles.  Several flying vehicles are visible, including two prominent ones near the top of the image that appear to be spaceships or advanced aircraft.  The vehicles on the ground appear futuristic and sleek.

* **Lighting:** The scene is brightly lit, with neon lights from the buildings contributing to a vibrant, almost electric atmosphere. The light sources create a sense of depth and movement. The overall color palette is a mixture of dark blues, pinks, and purples, with brighter neon accents.

* **Atmosphere:** The setting suggests a nighttime scene in a futuristic metropolis, possibly a spaceport or advanced technological hub. The flying vehicles and glowing buildings enhance the futuristic, high-tech aesthetic.  The overall mood is one of vibrant energy and technological advancement.

* **Other Details:**  A large digital screen or billboard is visible on the lower right, adding to the futuristic feel. Smaller details such as street lights and smaller buildings further populate the scene.


There's no discernible text besides what might be labeling or branding on some of the buildings, which is too small to read.  The focus is purely on the visual representation of the futuristic city.

## Post #205 by Saransh_Saini (Post ID: 613669)
I am going to clarify this once and for all

The response should be a 
JSON Object
 with the value of the 
"answer"
 key as a string.


{ "answer" : "YOUR_ANSWER_AS_STRING" }



This is the way we are expecting your responses.

However, due to the heavy confusion among students and will be considering responses with entire JSON objects stringified. We don‚Äôt want anyone to loose their marks for such a miniscule error.

So,


"{\"answer\": \"YOUR_ANSWER\"}"



is also valid.

Sir, I have an issue in GA5 Q3


What is the number of successful GET requests for pages under 
/telugu/
 from 
11:00
 until before 
20:00
 on Mondays?


For this, I have used two python scripts to get the answer, one written completely by me and another from someone else‚Äôs solution; both give the same answer - 
2698


However, the portal says it‚Äôs incorrect. No modifications resulting in different answer are being accepted either and the modifications themselves seem to break the bounds of the question.


Please check the scripts and tell me where I am going wrong.


My script:


import subprocess
from datetime import datetime

def isDay(dtobj, day):
  return dtobj.weekday() == day

def isTime(dtobj, l, u):
  return l <= dtobj.hour < u

step1 = subprocess.run("cat data | grep -i 'GET /telugu/'", capture_output=True, shell=True, text=True)
subprocess.run("rm -f forstep2.txt", shell=True)
with open('forstep2.txt', 'a') as f:
  for line in step1.stdout.splitlines():
    try:
      status = int(line.split()[8])
    except Exception as e:
      status = 400
    if 200 <= status < 300:
      f.write(line + '\n')
step2 = subprocess.run("cat forstep2.txt | cut -d ' ' -f4", capture_output=True, shell=True, text=True)
count = 0
for line in step2.stdout.splitlines():
  log_datetime = datetime.strptime(line.strip('['), "%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S")
  if(isDay(log_datetime, 0) and isTime(log_datetime, 11, 20)):
    count += 1

count



I had extracted and uploaded the 
data
 after extraction using gzip into colab and then executed the script.


The other script:

Both give the same output: 2698. Please help me identify the error, if any.

There is a "Learn More" link concerning country availability.  The form also explains that providing the school name will assist Microsoft in verification.  A small upward-pointing arrow is visible in the upper-right corner of the section header, suggesting a way to collapse or expand the form.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/c/5caf6ab37f4494ba32c8d50ccfae06cf4004990f.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a simple form field with a label and an email address.

* **Label:** "School email address" is displayed above the input field.  This indicates the type of information expected.

* **Input Field:** A rectangular text input box is present below the label. It contains a single email address: `21f3002277@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.  The field appears to be designed for the user to enter or edit an email address.  The email address shown is likely a placeholder or an example, and might be replaced by the user input.


The overall appearance suggests a portion of a web form or application interface.  The design is clean and minimalist.

Hi,

i deployed the application the application in render. It is free for 750 hours per month. But it is saying if the application is inactive mode, it will be go spin-off mode and take some 50 seconds to respond to the first query from inactive mode.

is that ok?

**Image Description:** The image shows a section of a user interface (UI) likely from a cloud computing platform's configuration panel.  The heading "Inbound port rules" indicates the purpose of this section: to manage which network ports on a virtual machine are accessible from the public internet.

The UI presents two radio buttons for choosing how to handle inbound port access:

* **None:**  This option completely blocks all inbound public network traffic to the virtual machine.
* **Allow selected ports:**  This option allows inbound traffic only on the specified ports.

A dropdown menu labeled "Select inbound ports" is below the radio buttons and currently shows "SSH (22)" selected. This means that only port 22 (typically used for SSH, a secure shell protocol) is open to the public internet.  Note that this dropdown implies the ability to select more ports.

A warning box appears below the dropdown. This warning highlights a security risk: opening a port to all IP addresses (as currently configured) will allow anyone on the internet to connect to the virtual machine. The warning recommends only using this configuration for testing purposes and suggests using the more granular controls ("Advanced controls") found on a "Networking" tab to restrict access to specific known IP addresses for production environments.

In summary, the image depicts a security-sensitive configuration setting where allowing access via port 22 to all IP addresses is a risk and better practices are described.

Respected Sir,


We kindly request a one-day extension for Project 2, as we finished with vivas and OPPE yesterday only. The circumstances this time have been more challenging than in Project 1, making it difficult to meet the deadline.


We would be extremely grateful if you could consider this request. Your support would be highly appreciated.


Thank you for your time and consideration.

What is the request timeout for each question, especially for the question on YouTube video transcription? I request the timeout to be at least 40-60 seconds as yt-dlp and faster-whisper take take to download the audio, load the model and run it on cpu and get the transcription.

For 259.7 to 351.8 seconds, it is taking around 1.5 mins, but it is giving the correct answer.


So I request you to shorten the length of the audio or increase the request timeout or both in moderation.


Question ‚Äî> the ‚Äúquestion‚Äù sent to the api will have the youtube video link, right? Or since the video is same for everyone, can I just have the audio file ready in the project? Will the api be tested against any YouTube video other than the Mystery Story Audiobook link given in the GA question?


Edit: Even with a preprocessed audio file (mp3, speech optimized, 32K), what‚Äôs taking the longest time is joining the transcribed sentences into a single string. That alone is taking >50 seconds. Please suggest a way to make it faster.


Regards,

Shivaditya

For the FastAPI type questions, my endpoints are like

**Image Description:** This image shows a code prompt or assignment.  It instructs the user to:

1. **Download a file:** Download a JSON file named `q-vercel-python.json` containing the marks of 108 imaginary students.

2. **Create and deploy an API:** Create a Python application and deploy it to Vercel.  This app should expose an API endpoint. When a GET request is made to this endpoint with query parameters `name=X` and `name=Y`, the API should return a JSON response containing the marks for X and Y in the same order.  An example JSON response is provided: `{"marks": [10, 20]}`.

3. **Enable CORS:** The instructions emphasize enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow GET requests from any origin.

4. **Identify the Vercel URL:** The final part asks for the Vercel URL of the deployed application. It should follow the format `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`.  A solution is provided: `https://vercel-tds-one.vercel.app/api`.

In essence, the task involves building a simple API using Python and Vercel that returns student marks based on input names.  The provided `q-vercel-python.json` likely acts as a sample data source.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/7/d7cac5f5c3125be67b63fec21c325396bc97a549.png)

**Image Description:** The image contains a set of instructions, likely for setting up and using a large language model (LLM).¬†


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Instruction 1:** Download a file named "Llamafile" and run a specific LLM model, "Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6_K.llamafile," using it.  The filenames suggest this is related to the Llama family of LLMs.

* **Instruction 2:** Create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using the "ngrok" tool.  Ngrok is a service that exposes local servers to the internet.

* **Instruction 3:** This section asks the user to determine the ngrok URL. It provides an example of what the URL might look like, showing a generic placeholder `[random]`  in place of the unique alphanumeric part.

* **Example URL:** A concrete example of an ngrok URL is given: `https://aafb-2405-201-4007-c068-eb1d-b640-5d42-2493.ngrok-free.app`. This is likely the user's specific ngrok URL generated after running the instructions.


In short, the image shows a step-by-step guide for setting up and accessing a local Llama-based language model via a publicly accessible ngrok tunnel.  The key elements are the file names, the use of ngrok, and the example ngrok URL provided.

**Image Description:** The image shows a simple interface, likely part of a web application or online test.  The text states that there is a hidden input field (not visible) containing a secret value just above the visible paragraph. The user is asked: "What is the value in the hidden input?"  A text input field is provided for the user to enter their answer. Finally, a blue button labeled "Check" is present, presumably to submit the answer for verification.

**Image Description:** The image shows a coding exercise or quiz question.  The question asks the user to use CSS selectors to find all `<div>` elements within a hidden element that have the class "foo".  The goal is to determine the sum of the `data-value` attributes of those `<div>` elements.  There is a text box provided for the user to enter their answer and a button labeled "Check" presumably to verify the answer.  The relevant parts of the question are:

* **Instruction:** Find all `<div>` elements with the class "foo".
* **Attribute to sum:** `data-value` attributes of the selected `<div>` elements.
* **Input field:** A blank text box for the user to input the sum of the `data-value` attributes.
* **Check button:** A button to submit the answer for verification.

The hidden element containing the `<div>` elements is not shown in the image, but it's implied to exist in the context of the exercise.

**Image Description:** Here's a description of the image content:

The image shows a question about calculating total sales from a SQLite database table.  The top section describes a table named `tickets` with three columns: `type`, `units`, and `price`.  Each row represents a customer's bid for a concert ticket.  A sample of the data is shown in a table format:

| type     | units | price |
| -------- | ----- | ----- |
| bronze   | 297   | 0.6   |
| Bronze   | 673   | 1.62  |
| Silver   | 105   | 1.26  |
| Silver   | 82    | 0.79  |
| SILVER   | 121   | 0.84  |
| ...      |       |       |

Note the inconsistencies in capitalization for `bronze`, `Bronze`, and `SILVER`. This is important as the database might be case-sensitive.

The question at the bottom asks: "What is the total sales of all the items in the "Gold" ticket type? Write SQL to calculate it."  A large black box obscures the expected SQL code answer.

I managed to get api keys but ended up in only text mining without file handing (not able to do multipart-form data). So, I have made to use  the model and designed a frontend which also takes the input from the file uploaded, So, it will be ideal for assignment solver, Isn‚Äôt it , Sir?

**Image Description:** The image shows a webpage interface for an "AI Assignment Solver."  The page is designed to help users solve assignments using AI.

The key features are:

* **Title:**  "AI Assignment Solver" is prominently displayed at the top.
* **File Upload:** A section allows users to upload a file ("Choose File") using a button labeled "Upload".  The message "No file uploaded." indicates that no file has been selected yet.
* **Question Input:**  Below the file upload section, users can "Ask a Question" by typing their question into a text box.
* **Submit Button:** A "Submit" button processes the uploaded file or question.
* **Answer Display:**  A text box labeled "Answer will appear here" is meant to display the AI's response to the uploaded file or question.

The overall design is simple and straightforward, using a light purple gradient background.  The interface is clearly aimed at making it easy for users to input their assignments or questions and receive AI-generated solutions.

**Image Description:** The image contains a calculation of a total value, presumably related to complaints.  The top section lists several monetary values, some with repeating entries (e.g., multiple instances of 1,000.00). These are then re-listed in a second section, with one entry (‚Äú5,000.00‚Äù) representing a summation of similar, subsequent entries not explicitly shown.  Finally, a detailed addition is performed, explicitly summing all the listed values (including the summarized 5,000.00 entry) to arrive at a grand total of **2,073,684.00**.  The text concludes by stating that this is the total value of the complaints. The numbers are formatted as currency values (with decimal points and possibly commas as thousands separators depending on regional conventions). The background is a light purple or lavender color.

**Image Description:** The image shows a code execution output likely from a web API request.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the content:

**1. API Request:**

* The top section displays a `curl` command used to make a POST request to the API endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/`.
* The request includes headers specifying the acceptance of JSON responses and the content type as `multipart/form-data`.
* The request body contains the question: "ShopSmart is an online retail platform that places a high value on customer feedback. Each month, the company receives hundreds of comments".


**2. API Response:**

* **Code:** The response code is 200 (OK), indicating successful execution.
* **Response Body:**  The most significant part is the JSON response body.  It contains a key "answer" whose value is a Python function and its usage example.

**3. Python Code:**

* The response includes a Python function named `cosine_similarity` that calculates the cosine similarity between two vectors (presumably word embeddings).
* It also includes a function `most_similar` which iterates through pairs of embeddings, calculates the cosine similarity for each pair using the `cosine_similarity` function, and returns the pair with the highest similarity.
* There is an example usage of the `most_similar` function with a dictionary named `embeddings` providing sample phrase and vector pairs.  The output of this example shows several floating point numbers likely representing cosine similarity scores.


**In summary:** The image documents an API call that takes a question as input and returns a Python function capable of calculating cosine similarity between word embeddings and identifying the pair of phrases with the highest similarity score, along with an example of its usage and its output. The context suggests the application might be related to sentiment analysis or semantic search within customer feedback data.

**Image Description:** Here's a description of the image's content, focusing on text and relevant features:

The image shows a dark-themed web interface, likely a dashboard for managing a cloud computing or similar service.  The primary focus is on a project named "TDS-Project-2," which is running Python 3 and is currently in a free tier.

Key information displayed includes:

* **Project Details:** The top section shows the project name ("TDS-Project-2"), the programming language (Python 3), its status as "Free," an option to "Upgrade your instance," and a unique project ID (2313001764).  A URL (`https://tds-project-2-pnim.orrender.com`) is also visible, suggesting a connection to a rendering service.

* **Instance Status:** A prominent purple warning banner states that the free instance will shut down due to inactivity, potentially delaying requests by up to 50 seconds.  A button to "Upgrade now" is provided.

* **Deployment Status:** Below the warning, the deployment status shows the project's last commit ("Final Commit") and the time (March 31, 2025, at 4:38 PM) with a status of "In Progress." There's also a "Cancel deploy" button.

* **Control Features:** The bottom section features options for viewing logs, a search bar, live tailing, time zone selection (GMT+5:30), and buttons suggesting upload/download or similar actions.

* **Top-level Controls:** At the very top-right of the screen are dropdown menus for "Connect" and "Manual Deploy."

In summary, the image depicts a project management dashboard indicating a free-tier instance close to becoming inactive.  The user has options to upgrade, cancel the deployment or continue.  The overall context points toward a service like a cloud computing environment specifically geared towards development or rendering.

I‚Äôve completed up to Week 3 and just need a little extra time to wrap up Weeks 4 and 5 properly. A single day would really help me submit a more polished project without causing significant delays

**Image Description:** This image shows a server error message from a Vercel serverless function.  The key information is:

* **Headline:** "This Serverless Function has crashed."  This clearly indicates the problem.

* **Connectivity Checks:**  The message assures that the user's connection and the Vercel platform itself are functioning correctly. This implies the problem lies within the serverless function's code or its dependencies.

* **Error Code:**  `500: INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`. This is a generic HTTP status code indicating a problem on the server.

* **Specific Error Code:** `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED`. This is a more specific error code from Vercel, explaining the function failed to execute properly.

* **Error ID:** `bom1::48ghr-1743430791127-d99a1b77819a`. This unique ID can be used to track down the error in Vercel's logs.

* **Instructions for Visitors:** Visitors are advised to contact the website owner or try again later.

* **Instructions for Owners:** Owners are given a link (hyperlinked in the image) instructing them to learn how to fix the error and check the logs for further debugging information.

In short, the image displays a detailed error report useful for both users and developers.  The unique error ID is especially important for troubleshooting.

Hello Sir,

I hope you‚Äôre doing well. On behalf of all the students in our course, I wanted to request a deadline extension for the project 2. We‚Äôre all putting in our best effort, but we need a little more time to complete it properly.


If it‚Äôs possible to grant an extension, we would really appreciate it. Please let us know if you can consider this request.


Thank you for your time and understanding!

**Image Description:** The image shows a grey and white Scottish Fold kitten lying on its back.¬†


The kitten is predominantly white on its chest and belly, with grey tabby markings on its back and head.¬†Its paws are up, appearing as if it's in a praying or pleading position. Its eyes are wide and seem to express a somewhat anxious or worried expression. The background is a blurry, light brown wooden floor.¬†


There is no discernible text in the image. The focus is entirely on the kitten and its posture. The features most relevant to describing the image are the kitten's breed (Scottish Fold), its coloring, and its body position which contributes to its overall expression.

Due to slow internet connectivity and the absence of WiFi, my submission took longer than usual. As a result, I was only able to upload it at 12:01 AM instead of the regular 11:59 PM deadline.

PLEASE Sir, As I‚Äôm a standalone student and this is my primary degree after 12th, please do accept it.

**Image Description:** The image shows Tom the Cat from the Tom and Jerry cartoons. He is depicted in a kneeling position, his paws pressed together as if in prayer.  His eyes are closed, and his expression appears to be one of pleading or desperation.

The background is a simple, muted landscape.  It features a light beige or tan ground, possibly sand or dirt, with a suggestion of a distant body of water (possibly the sea or a lake) and a small portion of a tree in the upper right corner.¬†The overall color palette is muted and warm.  There's no text visible in the image.

The focus is entirely on Tom's pose and expression, suggesting a scene where he is seeking forgiveness, help, or mercy. The setting provides little context other than an outdoor location.

My project is hosted on render, because vercel refuses to cooperate with me, as a result the free version of render takes a minute to respond, and not only that but might also give internal server error until the 2nd or 3rd try. There is nothing I can do to change this except for maybe sending requests every now and then like it was suggested for another student using render. I just want to know if this is okay for evaluation.

@Saransh_Saini
 please reply me.


What is this going on? Is it joking? Our teachers don‚Äôt have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don‚Äôt have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don‚Äôt think so that they really made any effort in our course. In project-2 also, we need solutions for all graded assignments and so many students request for solutions but our the great teachers ignores the request and didn‚Äôt provide the solutions. I think they provide the projects whatever comes in their dreams during sleeping. In weekly study material, don‚Äôt have their notes, even they have a very few videos made by them, they just render to other YouTuber‚Äôs Youtube videos and online websites. Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India‚Äôs top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don‚Äôt ask anything.


Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- "We won‚Äôt be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. ". I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. But on extending the deadline of project-2 just only for one day, their evaluation will be late. In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. It is our tales it is my right to get solutions for every weekly assignment, but don‚Äôt ask them to make efforts. Just pay and do assignments at own risk even you have not understand anything from the copy-pasted material. Just use AI‚Äôs or read whatever and wherever you want to read.


It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.


Thankyou to all my respected ‚ÄòThe Great Teachers‚Äô.

hi,


I dont share your views.


i feel it was one of the best course in whole of Diploma.


I have learned a lot in these projects and even in ROE preparation.


all the things we are learning here are open in market and the course contents are great direction towards learning and practicing them.


I agree it is stessful, my whole team were in a 9-hour g-meet call on Saturday night. but we have found solutions, shared ideas, try-outs, made fun of each other.


but at the end of the day we all agree that we have learnt lots of new things.


Regarding Project1 delay: if we think, atleast 1GB of docker image per students for 700+ students. even if parallalize the execution 5 students at a time you still need a very powerfull system to download and amount of data downloading etc‚Ä¶ At the end of the day we got a very good result and report with logs to verify


for GA‚Äôs: it is upto you to copy solutions or learn something out of each GA sections


All in all I am happy with the course.

Dear Shahzada,


You joined Discourse almost a year ago Jun 8th, 2023. In all that time you have read 832 posts. And never interacted with anyone on discourse. You finally decided to interact once and that was today and this is your first post (your second if we count that you deleted your first post)


The first step to receiving help is communication. If you do not communicate, no one can help you.








 23f2002668:




What is this going on? Is it joking?






I am not sure what your question is. I am not sure what you are referring to. Please be clear in your questions.








 23f2002668:




Our teachers don‚Äôt have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do?






We have made 
several hours of videos
 on Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself.








 23f2002668:




I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project.






Not sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared)








 23f2002668:




They explained what should be your approach? How to make project?






Yes these were explained if you




either took part in any live session or


watched the recorded video










 23f2002668:




And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times?






I am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks.








 23f2002668:




It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off.






Project 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words:

Create a server api that receives a request.

The request would be any question from the first 5 GAs.

The response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page.


Multiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions.








 23f2002668:




Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake?






Since this is your first post, you‚Äôve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process.


If you want solutions, there are several options:




Ask for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it)


Collaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration)


Join live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked)


Watch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment)










 23f2002668:




They don‚Äôt have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically.






This is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting.


The biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs‚Ä¶ with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning.








 23f2002668:




Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India‚Äôs top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers.






If you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video.


But feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up.


What are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that.


I absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you.








 23f2002668:




They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don‚Äôt ask anything.






Reading documentation is a skill you have to pick up. 
Having said that, we have always explained something that students have asked.
  Just ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world.


Now is a good time to start.








 23f2002668:




Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- "We won‚Äôt be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. "






That is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic.








 23f2002668:




I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1?






They have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time.


Luckily for you,
 our first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be).








 23f2002668:




The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers.






If you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion.








 23f2002668:




In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal.






Anand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution?


Also if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month  etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script.


But validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime.


You can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback.








 23f2002668:




It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.


Thankyou to all my respected ‚ÄòThe Great Teachers‚Äô.






I am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither 
respect
 nor 
kindness
 is evident in your post.


But thank you for your feedback.


One final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score.


And when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve.


Kind regards,

TDS team

Hi, I have a few things to say


My background :


I have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term.


My Initial Disappointments with this Course


In one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction):




The video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended.






Here, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn‚Äôt like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph


ROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful.


There are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily.




Why did I fail?


Last Term


I dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn‚Äôt practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon.


This term.


I made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn‚Äôt allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn‚Äôt submit both the projects.


In both the terms I didn‚Äôt collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn‚Äôt earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair.


Me Understanding about the Course Now


This one line changed my view about ROE.








On another topic




What does this RoE evaluate?
 Implicit learning.






I am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don‚Äôt know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough.


I scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS.


Now I realize that  I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time.


In MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing 
SKLearn
. Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE.


This course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an 
implicit
 way.


This is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code.


I have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks


I have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc.


I am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt.


From the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn‚Äôt do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn‚Äôt cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects.


Since this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too.


Thanks to 
@s.anand

@carlton
 , 
@Jivraj
  and 
@Saransh_Saini




Just two suggestions






I feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites.


While introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained. Also, address few questions in the video itself which are likely to be asked by us.

Hello Carlton,

Evaluations will start before this weekend, with some sampling done possibly even tonight and most evaluation runs tomorrow.


Also we will prime the target first by sending a dummy request so it gets ‚Äúwarmed up‚Äù because some of you have reported time to respond to first request takes time for the server to spin up.

Then once we know its responding, we will send requests for evaluation.


Kind regards

 sir, I have noticed that sometimes our vm based application gets stuck and on verifying every request using FastApi have noticed that best way to check is run and get your answer post that RESET it back and then run another query and it works perfectly fine, not sure have other faced this issue or not, but it would be great if you could take note of this while evaluating just for safety.


Hope you take note of this and take this into consideration.

## Post #327 by 21f2000588 (Post ID: 614807)
Okay so basically sometimes what happens is while verifying on FASTApi ‚Äì it gives errors like missing paramaters like‚Ä¶ So basically sometimes it needs resetting the request parser and then it works perfectly fine.


{
  "detail": "execute() missing 1 required positional argument: 'file_bytes'"
}



Which is incorrect, so if we press the RESET button and execute it works properly.

### Image Insight:
![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/9/2/9201a514dc9b85f1bef21a9b90a225754a65072f_2_690x280.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a web interface, likely an API testing tool or similar.  Here's a breakdown of the content:

**Top Section:**

* **Parameters:** A section labeled "Parameters" shows "No parameters," indicating there are no parameters defined for this request.
* **Buttons:**  Buttons for "Cancel" and "Reset" are present at the top right.

**Main Section (Request Body):**

* **Request Body:**  A section titled "Request body" (marked as "required" in red text), indicating that this section needs to be filled out for the request to proceed.
* **question:**  A field labeled "question" (also marked "required"), with the data type "string" specified.  A text box contains the prompt: "Download and use multi-cursors and convert it into a single".
* **file:** A field labeled "file," specifying allowed data types of `string | string | null | {} | binary`. A "Choose File" button is present, and the currently selected file is "q-multi-cursor.json.txt". There's a checkbox labeled "Send empty value".
* **multipart/form-data:** A dropdown menu in the top right corner is currently set to "multipart/form-data",  indicating the type of data being sent.

**Bottom Section:**

* **Execute Button:** A large, blue "Execute" button is prominent.  There's a smaller, gray "Clear" button next to it.
* **Responses:** A section labeled "Responses" is at the bottom left.  This area would presumably display the API's response after the "Execute" button is pressed.  "Curl" is visible, suggesting the ability to generate a cURL command representing the request.


**Overall Interpretation:**

The interface appears designed to send a request to an API.  The request includes a textual question and an accompanying JSON file ("q-multi-cursor.json.txt").  The purpose seems to be related to processing a file with the help of multiple cursors, possibly for editing or data manipulation within the context of the API. The "multipart/form-data" indicates the request will transmit both the text and file data.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/d/d/dd6c4fed0a92c88924a7bf38b2e19497253fca36_2_690x89.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of what appears to be a server response in a debugging or API testing tool.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Server response:** This header indicates the section displays information about a server's response to a request.

* **Code: 200:** This indicates a successful HTTP status code.  200 means the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.

* **Response body:** This label indicates the main content of the server's response.

* **JSON-like data:** Within the response body, there's a JSON-like structure.  The key `"answer"` is followed by a long string of hexadecimal characters ("7a5955793fe63e199a586776330b9cc59b84f724c8"). This likely represents some sort of data or identifier returned by the server.

* **Download button:** A button labeled "Download" is visible, suggesting the possibility of downloading the response body's contents.

* **Copy button:** A button with a copy icon is also visible. This suggests that the data can be copied.

In summary, the image displays a successful server response containing a long alphanumeric string identified as an "answer," which can potentially be downloaded or copied. The hexadecimal nature of the string suggests it might be a hash, token, or some encoded data.

Sometimes it takes a bit longer because some lessons are harder than others. And we all make mistakes. But if you‚Äôve learnt something valuable on the journey, then you are better prepared for what comes next regardless of whether you could clear the obstacle the first time or not.

The way we test your api is 
not through a front end.


We send a request to the endpoint directly. We have demoed it in live sessions.


We have even posted on discourse snippets of what this looks like.


As long as your endpoint responds to a request that we send, it will be fine.


Kind regards

Dear 
@Carlton
 and 
@S.Anand
,

I successfully deployed my project on Vercel, and it works perfectly when tested using curl commands. Each task installs its required packages and runs as expected. However, I encountered an issue with Vercel‚Äôs free version, which has a 250MB limit. While my project‚Äôs size without installed packages is approximately 34MB, the size exceeds the limit once packages like Pandas, NumPy, Pillow, Whisper, and Uvicorn are installed, causing the server to crash.

Could you kindly suggest any alternatives or solutions for this issue? I would greatly appreciate your guidance, as I fear all my hard work might go to waste without a resolution.

---

## Post #334 by carlton (Post ID: 615145)
We are in the processing pipeline. You will have to wait till it completes. Basically if your endpoint works when we send it a request you will be evaluated. We will use the timestamp of your latest endpoint before the deadline.


Hope that answers your question.

---

## Post #335 by carlton (Post ID: 615147)
The alternative is to use vercel purely as an endpoint service that processes most things without large libraries, and for more heavy duty backend work forwards the request to another system that handles it and sends it back to your vercel function which then relays the answer to the request.

---

## Post #336 by 23f2005702 (Post ID: 615150)
in spreadsheet edit response modify previous response with timestamp, how you can access that timestamp response?? So how can u have my end point before deadline one since i updated it after deadline.

Also the before deadline one end point is

/api which i changed to /api/ after deadline so if u somehow have access to my old url pls consider adding 1 (slash) / :')

## Post #337 by carlton (Post ID: 615152)
gform allows multiple submissions. i would have to check with 
@s.anand
 if its been enabled, i almost certain he has configured it for multiple submissions.

---

## Post #338 by 23f2005702 (Post ID: 615153)
I understand your point but what I am saying is that when I edited my end point after deadline it changed my timestamp to after deadline one so that is my concern that my submission might not be even considered

---

## Post #339 by carlton (Post ID: 615155)
you can have multiple submissions with multiple timestamps in gform. (unless you chose to edit your response, in that situation i have not tested what actually happens).

 From Problem to Platform: Building ‚ÄúVicky‚Äù ‚Äì A Smart Data Science Assistant for TDS @ IIT Madras


 
Project Demo Website
: 
https://app.algsoch.tech


During our college course 
Tool for Data Science (TDS)
 at 
IIT Madras
, we were tasked with a challenging but exciting project: 
to build a platform that can take in natural language questions and execute corresponding solutions through an API
.


 The Mission:


Create a tool that behaves like a 
chatbot
, accepts 
user queries (text or file-based)
 via 
web or API
, processes them intelligently, 
executes the appropriate code
, and returns accurate results‚Äîlike a real data science assistant.




 The Journey: From Fails to Final


At first, the natural choice was to try 
LLM agents
‚Äîthey sounded magical. But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries. 


Then I thought‚Äîwhat if I manually mapped questions and answers using a 
static JSON structure
? That quickly broke when users passed 
different parameters, different files
, or queried in 
non-standard formats
 like ‚Äúcode -s‚Äù or ‚Äúcode -v‚Äù.


The next idea: write 
individual Python scripts per question
 from our Graded Assignments (GA1‚ÄìGA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable. 




 The Breakthrough: Dynamic Function Mapping


After multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture:


 Centralized engine in 
vicky_server.py


 Uses 
regex-based pattern matching
 to detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solution


 Each solution is a structured Python function like 
ga1_first_solution(query=None)


 Supports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and more


 Acts like a 
mini compiler for data science tools




 Presenting Vicky ‚Äì The Mini Chatbot for TDS 


Vicky is a 
smart, modular chatbot
 built specifically for 
Tool for Data Science at IIT Madras
. It‚Äôs packed with real functionality‚Äînot just templates.


Key Features:


 
Graded Assignment Solver

Handles dynamic, real-world questions from GA1 to GA5 like:




code -s
 / 
code -v
 ‚Üí VS terminal commands


Create FastAPI API for CSV with filtering/searching


GitHub automation: repo creation, GitHub Actions setup


Data cleaning, scraping from IMDb, image compression




 
File Upload with Query Matching

Users can upload a file (CSV, JSON, Excel) and ask file-specific queries. The system understands context and dynamically links the query to the uploaded file.


 
HTML Viewer + Base64 Decoder




View any website in rendered & source format using CORS proxy


Upload Base64 string ‚Üí Get original image back




 
Webhooks Integration




Live notifications via 
Discord
 & 
Slack
 whenever 
/api
 endpoints are accessed


Monitors 
server status (online/offline)
 and sends real-time updates




 
LLM Download + Auto Tunneling




Downloads LLaMA models


Dynamically finds available ports


Creates and exposes tunneled endpoints




 
Live Web UI at 
app.algsoch.tech




Ask any TDS question


Upload and query with files


Image decoder


Graded assignment slider navigation


HTML viewer


API health status






 Built With:




FastAPI
 for blazing fast APIs


Regex & Pattern Matching
 for dynamic input detection


GitHub Copilot
 + my Python debugging and architectural thinking


Full webhook and status monitoring system


Modular backend (
vicky_server.py
) and web frontend (
vicky_app.py
)




I want to extend a huge thank you to 
@s.anand
 for their guidance on this project. I‚Äôve learned what prompt engineering is and how we can leverage large language models (LLMs). One interesting takeaway is that while these technologies won‚Äôt replace our jobs‚Äîespecially for those who understand programming‚Äîthey will create new job opportunities instead.

Now I am capable of how fastapi work and more things and how to structure code and how to design code and most important what to think for project

Dear Sir,

I would like to clarify the situation regarding my previous submission. Initially, I provided an ngrok link, but due to an error with ngrok, it stopped working. I then found an alternative solution using Cloudflare with a custom domain that I obtained through the GitHub Student Pack. I successfully created a tunnel, and it is currently functional. I can shut down my laptop, and it still works with the same URL when I restart.

I hope you will consider my case. I submitted my work at that time because I learned about this solution from a fellow student on Discord. I only changed the URL and made no other modifications.

Thank you for your understanding

Hi 
@carlton


The same issue has affected several of us. During the last Google Meet session, we explained the situation to 
@Saransh_Saini
.


It seems that when we edit our responses, the timestamp with other values updates not submitted as new response. However, the position of the response in the form remains unchanged. For instance, we submitted our response at 11:30 PM on March 31st, and someone else submitted theirs at 11:45 PM. Even after editing our response the next day, our entry still appears above theirs.

We just wanted to clarify: Will responses edited or submitted on April 1st still be considered, given that the form remains open? If not, is there any way we can show proof of our original submission? Currently, we have email confirmations for both the initial and the edited responses.


We hope this won‚Äôt be a major issue, especially not on the level of Project 1 concerns. Looking forward to a positive resolution from the TDS team.


Thank you

Lakshay

Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Top Navigation Bar:** The top shows multiple browser tabs, including an email inbox, links related to Azure for Students and a project ("Project 2 - TDS Solver").  The address bar shows the URL: `https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/Balance`.

* **Main Content:** The main content area displays:

    * **"SPONSORED" header:**  Clearly indicating a sponsored Azure account.

    * **Usage Summary:** A circular graph visually representing the usage of the sponsorship.
        * **Total Credit:** 100 USD
        * **Used:** 26 USD
        * **Remaining:** 74 USD

    * **Subscription Details:** Shows that there is 1 active subscription.  A note indicates the balance is based on usage through April 4th, 2025.

    * **Dates:**  The validity period of the sponsorship is shown as March 18th, 2025 to March 18th, 2026.

    * **Account Email:**  The email address `23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` is clearly visible.  This is likely the student's or account holder's email.

* **Right-hand Panel:** A separate section labeled "Subscription Usage," displays a unique subscription ID (`3def2d44-91a8-495d-81ff`) and specifies that it's an "Azure for Students" account.


In summary, the image displays a dashboard showing the status of a sponsored Microsoft Azure account for a student associated with the email address `23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`, including its credit balance, usage, and expiration date.

Sir, please note that after the deadline I haven‚Äôt resubmitted the form but I have edited it (as the form was allowing editing till then). Now what exactly have I edited is just added a ‚Äú/‚Äù at the end and that‚Äôs it and nothing more. Highlighting it again, I haven‚Äôt resubmitted the form but edited it on the very next morning after the deadline.


So now my question is: My edited response will be accepted right in this case?

**Image Description:** The image shows a terminal log, likely from a Linux system, displaying a series of HTTP requests and responses.  The log entries are timestamped, showing activity throughout April 5th, between approximately 2 PM and 6 PM.  Each line provides the following information:

* **Date and Time:**  Shows the date (Apr 05) and time of each event.
* **TDS:** Likely a tag or identifier for the system or process generating the log.
* **python [79249]:** Indicates the log originates from a Python process (PID 79249).
* **INFO/WARNING:** The log level indicating the nature of the event (Informational or Warning).
* **IP Address and Port:** The IP address and port number of the client making the request.
* **HTTP Request:** The HTTP method (GET or POST), the requested path, and the HTTP version.
* **HTTP Response:** The HTTP status code and a short description.

Many of the requests resulted in a "404 Not Found" response, indicating that the server could not find the requested resource. Some requests were successful ("200 OK").  A few requests received a "405 Method Not Allowed" response, indicating the HTTP method used was inappropriate for the resource. One entry shows an "Invalid HTTP request received" warning.

The bottom line shows the user's current working directory: `azureuser@TDS:~ $`.

The log provides information about the network activity of a Python application running on the system, showing various attempts to access different resources on different servers. The frequent 404 errors suggest potential misconfigurations or incorrect paths in the application's requests. The presence of "autodiscover.json" suggests possible interaction with an email server or similar service.

 I‚Äôm noticing frequent requests from globally scattered IPs‚Äîmostly from cloud or bulletproof hosts like DigitalOcean, Contabo, and Azure‚Äîtargeting sensitive paths like 
/t4
, 
/logincheck
, 
/.env
, and 
/.git/config
. These include IPs from places like New York (162.243.238.100), London (34.89.64.89), Amsterdam (45.148.10.172), Moscow (84.201.151.18), Jaipur (103.175.163.104), and Vilnius (85.255.108.243). It really seems like automated vulnerability scanning or botnet activity. Carlton, what can I do??

Also a better evaluation strat would be to submit the GitHub repo in the form(Else they can make changes to the repo, who checks the commit history?) and maybe conduct a 2 min demo where the student clones the repo and then you run the script?

I know many students are there but other subjects do it for project courses?


Maybe a helpful tip for next time


If i do fail and repeat this course. Hopefully not XD

I started it once again. Can you please reevaluate it now if it hasn‚Äôt been done yet. I actually tested it till 3rd of April and it was working fine. I don‚Äôt know what actually happened. Please do consider.


Actually in the free tier there are many issues. These issues are beyond our control and I request the TDS team to please consider this issue and please consider re-evaluating it if it has not been done yet as we had put in a lot of efforts.

**Image Description:** This image shows a log of HTTP requests received by a server, along with the server's responses.  The log entries are timestamped and include the following information for each request:

* **WARNING/INFO:** Indicates the severity level of the log entry.  "WARNING" suggests a problem, while "INFO" shows normal activity.
* **IP Address and Port:**  The source IP address and port number of the HTTP request.  These identify the client making the request.
* **HTTP Method:**  Usually "GET" (to retrieve data) or "POST" (to send data to the server).
* **Requested Path:** The URL path requested by the client, after the domain name. This reveals which resources the client tried to access.  Many paths suggest attempts to access login pages or other administrative interfaces.  Some paths indicate attempts to access specific files or directories such as `/index.html`, `/login.jsp`, or `/webpages/login.html`.  Some are invalid or nonsensical requests, like `.env.bak`.
* **HTTP Version:** The version of the HTTP protocol used (e.g., HTTP/1.1).
* **Status Code:** Almost all requests result in a "404 Not Found" status code, indicating the server could not find the requested resource.  There are also a few "Invalid HTTP request received" warnings, indicating malformed requests.

The log concludes with messages indicating the server is shutting down and the process has finished.  The large number of 404 errors might suggest a misconfiguration of the web server, incorrect file paths, or potentially malicious attempts to access restricted resources. The log provides a valuable record for troubleshooting the server's performance and security.

@Carlton
, I believe you all have evaluated it. For me, there are some requests from a known IP with the following location details:


{'status': 'success', 'country': 'India', 'countryCode': 'IN', 'region': 'TN', 'regionName': 'Tamil Nadu', 'city': 'Chennai', 'zip': '600042', 'lat': 13.0895, 'lon': 80.2739, 'timezone': 'Asia/Kolkata', 'isp': 'IIT Madras', 'org': 'IITM', 'as': 'AS141340 IIT Madras', 'query': '103.158.43.17'}



This request was made at 4:38:19 IST.

**Image Description:** The image shows a terminal screen displaying log entries.  The log entries appear to be from a Python application (indicated by `python[79249]`) running on a server.  The logs show a series of HTTP requests made to the server.

Key details include:

* **Timestamp:** Each log entry is timestamped with date and time (e.g., "Apr 06 11:08:19").

* **Hostname/IP Address:**  The IP address `103.158.43.17` is consistently shown as the source of the requests.

* **Username:** The username `azureuser@TDS` is visible at the bottom, suggesting a user logged into a system named TDS.

* **HTTP Method:** The logs show both GET and POST requests.  A GET request is made to `/favicon.ico`, a common request for website icons. Multiple POST requests are made to `/api`, indicating interaction with a server-side API.

* **HTTP Status Codes:** All the POST requests received a 200 OK status code, meaning they were successfully processed.  The GET request also received a 200 OK status.

* **Process ID:** The process ID `[79249]` suggests that multiple requests were processed by the same Python process.


In summary, the image captures log output from an application receiving numerous requests to its API endpoint. The user's current command prompt indicates they are awaiting a command, while the log displays ongoing API interactions.

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a web application, likely a tool for making API requests.  The main focus is a POST request being made to the URL `4.213.61.248:8080/api`.

**Key features:**

* **Request Method:** A POST request is being sent.
* **URL:** The target URL is `4.213.61.248:8080/api`.
* **Body:** The request body is in JSON format.  It contains a key "question" with the value "what is output of -s?".  The response is also in JSON, showing system information (OS version, CPU details, memory, etc.)  This suggests the API is likely providing information about the system's configuration.
* **Headers:** The Headers section is visible but its content isn't fully shown in the screenshot.
* **Response:** The response code is `200 OK`, indicating a successful request. The response size is 2.08 KB, and the request took 5 seconds to complete.
* **Tabs:** The interface includes tabs for "Params," "Authorization," "Headers," "Body," "Scripts," and "Settings."  The "Body" tab is currently active. Other tabs suggest further options for customizing the request.
* **"Form-Data" Selected:**  The "form-data" radio button under the "Params" section is selected indicating that data is sent as form data.
* **"Visualize" Tab:** The "Visualize" tab is visible and could be used to view the response in a more user-friendly format.

In short, the screenshot depicts an API call that queries a system for its configuration details ("what is output of -s?"), receiving a successful JSON response containing a detailed description of the system's environment. The application used seems to be a debugging or testing tool for APIs.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/b/6/b648e1445e752d02cebfac10a95e9d507f9a4ad3_2_690x105.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a log output, likely from a server or API interaction.  The output is primarily a JSON response containing details about a function call named "solver_1". Key details include:

* **Function Call Details:** The JSON details a function named "solver_1," which appears to execute a command within VS Code.  The command itself is "-s," although the context of this command isn't readily apparent from the log. The function call's purpose is described as giving output from a specific command.

* **Response Data:** The response includes information like:
    * `id`: A unique identifier for the completion (chatcmpl-87K7nbeTemPJrZ1AttZaXXXqHBCkwG)
    * `object`:  Indicates the type of response (chat completion).
    * `created`: A timestamp indicating when the response was generated.
    * `model`: The model used (gpt-40-mini-2024-07-18).
    * `choices`: An array containing the function call results (index 0).
    * `usage`: Token usage statistics (prompt tokens, completion tokens, total tokens).
    * `cost`:  The cost of the function call.
    * `costError`: An error message indicating a problem with `crypto.createHash`.  This suggests a cryptographic function is not working correctly.

* **HTTP Request Log:** Below the main JSON, there is a log message showing a successful HTTP POST request to `/api`.  The status code `200 OK` confirms the request was successful. The IP address (54.86.50.139) and port (41710) are visible, along with the request method and path.  The final line shows what seems like a user or system identifier (23f2000599@ds.study.iitm.ac.in@TDS-PROJECT).

In short, the image presents a server log detailing a function call that failed due to a `crypto.createHash` error, despite a successful HTTP request. The log data includes several identifiers and usage statistics to aid in debugging and monitoring.

The same thing has happened to me as the mentioned above. I also have not received request from Indian IP as far as I can see on the logs. I am using the azure VM itself.

I rechecked and maybe the server went offline, so I re-ran the script anyway and checked a few questions now and it works.

I think after a certain while it timed out for me(not entirely sure tho)‚Ä¶ but i fixed it.

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a web application, likely a REST API testing tool.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Top Bar:**  Shows the project name (`TDS-Project2-Testing-Again`), a path (`/gal/q1-working-now`), buttons for saving and sharing, and a "Send" button.

* **POST Request Section:**  This section indicates a POST request is being made to the URL `104.211.116.95:8080/api`.

* **Params Tab:** Shows parameters for the request.  Two checkboxes are present: `question` (checked) and `file` (unchecked).  These appear to allow sending data as key-value pairs.

* **Headers Tab:** A header section (partially visible) shows information about the request headers (9 are listed).

* **Body Tab (selected):** This section is actively selected and shows options for sending the request body. `form-data` is selected, suggesting a multipart form data POST request. A JSON formatted response is displayed in the preview, showing version and system information.

* **Scripts Tab:** This tab is present, indicating a potential for sending scripts as part of the request.

* **Settings Tab:**  Visible but no specific content is clear.

* **Cookies Tab:**  Present, but no cookies shown.

* **Response Section (bottom):**  The response from the server is displayed, showing:
    * **200 OK:** Indicating a successful response (HTTP status code 200).
    * **3.86 s:** Response time.
    * **2.08 KB:** Response size.
    * **Save Response:**  Button to save the response.
    * **JSON formatted response:**  A large JSON object, the contents describe various system parameters (version info, CPU details, memory, GPU capabilities, rendering settings, etc.).

**In summary,** the image displays the process of sending a POST request, likely to gather system information. The response includes system details about the target server or device. The use of a JSON response is standard for API communication.  The various tabs suggest the application provides comprehensive tools for testing and interacting with APIs.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/9/b/9b64c8881a11f6110514f83dabb9e733f46865d9_2_690x321.png)

**Image Description:** This image shows a screenshot of what appears to be a POST request being made through an API testing tool, likely Postman or a similar application. Let's break down the key elements:

**Top Section:**

* **`TDS-Project2-Testing-Again / ga5 / q5-working`**: This seems to be a project or test identifier.  `TDS` might be an abbreviation for a project name or system.  `ga5` and `q5-working` could refer to specific stages or iterations of the test.

* **`POST`**: This indicates the HTTP method used for the request (sending data to the server).

* **`104.211.116.95:8080/api`**: This is the API endpoint URL, specifying the server's IP address, port number (8080), and the API path (`/api`).

* **`Params`, `Authorization`, `Headers (9)`, `Body`, `Scripts`, `Settings`**: These are tabs or sections within the API testing tool, indicating various aspects of the request configuration.  The "(9)" after "Headers" suggests 9 headers are currently defined.

* **`form-data`**: This is the selected encoding type for the request body.  It's commonly used when submitting forms with files and other data.

* **`Send`**: This button sends the API request.

**Body Section (most important part):**

* **Key-Value Pairs:** Two key-value pairs are defined:
    * `question`: The value is set to "Sales Analytics at GlobalRetail Insights-".  This suggests the request is querying sales data from GlobalRetail Insights.
    * `file`: This points to a file called `q-clean-up-sales-data (7).json`.  The `.json` extension indicates it's a JSON file likely containing data to be processed by the API or used as input to the query.  The "(7)" might be a version number or an iteration.

* **Response:** The response at the bottom shows `200 OK`, indicating a successful request.  `3.68s` denotes the request's processing time, and `143 B` indicates the size of the response. The JSON response shows an answer with the value "10687", likely a result of the API's processing.

**Overall:**

The screenshot shows a test sending a file and a question to an API endpoint and receiving a numerical response. It's likely a test related to data analysis or reporting for GlobalRetail Insights, possibly involving some data cleaning or processing of the uploaded file (`q-clean-up-sales-data (7).json`).  The `200 OK` response suggests the test ran successfully.

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a terminal window on a Redmi Note 12 device.  The window is divided into sections labeled "DEBUG CONSOLE," "TERMINAL," "PORTS," "QUERY RESULTS (PREVIEW)," and "COMMENTS."

The main content is a log of numerous requests and responses, seemingly related to a data science tool.  Each entry includes:

* **A filepath:**  Indicating the Python script used for processing a particular query (e.g., `E://data science tool//GA2//third.py`).  These paths suggest an organized project structure.
* **A score:** A numerical value associated with the query's success or relevance (e.g., `(score: 8.30)`).
* **HTTP Request:** Showing a "POST" request sent to a specific URL (e.g., `"POST /ask HTTP/1.1"`), indicating interaction with a web service.  The response code `200 OK` signifies successful execution.
* **Timestamp:** Providing the time each request was processed (e.g., `43.17:0`).
* **Processing information:** The `tds_app` logs "INFO - Processing question:" followed by the question processed.
* **Question details:** A natural language question is shown for each entry, along with a description of data sources or APIs used for answering them.  These questions range from querying SQLite databases to using the Hacker News RSS API.  They appear to be examples or test cases for a data science tool.
* **A partial comment:**  The "COMMENTS" section contains a partially visible comment about LexiSolve Inc, a startup described as delivering a (presumably) conversational AI solution.

In summary, the screenshot depicts the log of a series of data science tasks performed using a custom tool. The logs provide detailed information about the queries, their execution, scores, and associated Python files, indicating a development or testing environment. The presence of natural language questions highlights the likely involvement of natural language processing. The timestamp and device name (Redmi Note 12) give context to when and where the screenshot was taken.

Hello,


I wanted to provide an update regarding the issue I faced while I was in Jammu. During my stay, my laptop was on, but I encountered an error that caused my endpoint to crash. It seemed that Cloudflared mentioned needing an update, which I believe contributed to the problem.


Now that I‚Äôm back in Delhi, I‚Äôm connected to the internet, and I‚Äôm happy to report that my endpoint is working again.


see this image I have designed my endpoint to monitor with discord webhook

**Image Description:** The image shows a dark-themed interface, possibly a debugging or monitoring console for an API.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Section:** This section displays information about API requests. It shows a total of 39 requests originating from a single IP address (43.230.106.157).  It also notes recent queries related to a FastAPI application developed for InfoCore Solutions, a technology consulting firm.¬†The queries involve accessing data (possibly movie data) from IMDb's advanced web search.  A URL (`https://www.imdb.com/search/title/`) is provided for this purpose.

* **IMDb Logo:** A prominent yellow square features the IMDb logo in black text. This indicates that the API likely interacts with the IMDb database.

* **API Status Alert:**¬†A critical alert box at the bottom declares the API at `app.algsoch.tech` to be "DOWN" or experiencing issues. The timestamp indicates the status was last checked at 2025-04-07 13:01:32 (note that the year is 2025).

In short, the image depicts an API monitoring dashboard indicating an outage or significant problem, likely impacting an application that uses IMDb data.  The information also provides context on the app's purpose and the company it was built for.

@Saransh_Saini

Sir, I saw from the logs on Cloud Run that my project was probably evaluated on 5th April at around 11:51 PM and all the requests made during that time resulted in 3 response status codes: 302, 307 and 405 by no fault of my app, but rather errors in the request itself. I mentioned the exactly correct URL of my app in the form but the evaluation logs show three different types of URL to which request was made. As I mentioned in the form, my url is of the format ‚Äúhttps://‚Ä¶/api/‚Äù and allows only POST requests.




The app was supposed to allow POST requests and I allowed only POST requests, so GET requests even to correct url resulted in 405 response


When POST requests were actually made, two wrong urls were used for all the POST requests

a. http://‚Ä¶/api/ ‚Üí resulted in 302 response

b. https://‚Ä¶/api  ‚Üí resulted in a 307

whereas the url I gave was of the format ‚Äúhttps://‚Ä¶/api/‚Äù




The logs from Cloud Run


image
982√ó552 133 KB


As you can see from the above logs, all POST requests made to my app have the wrong url, some have only http and some end with ‚Äú/api‚Äù instead of ‚Äú/api/‚Äù, both of which do not match with the correct url I gave in the Google Form (screenshot attached below).

I request you to re-evaluate my project 2 with the correct url exactly as I had submitted in the Google Form.


Thank you.

Shivaditya

**Image Description:** This image shows a log of HTTP requests and responses.  Each line represents a single request, with the following information:

* **Timestamp:** The date and time of the request (e.g., `2025-04-05 23:51:12.872`).
* **Request Type:**  Indicates whether the request was a `GET`, `POST`, or other HTTP method.
* **Status Code:** A three-digit number indicating the server's response (e.g., `307` for Temporary Redirect, `405` for Method Not Allowed, `302` for Found, `200` for OK).
* **Response Size:** The size of the response in bytes (e.g., `140 B`).
* **Response Time:** The time it took for the server to respond, in milliseconds (ms).
* **Client:**  Appears to indicate the client making the request, consistently showing `python-reque` or `python-httpx`.
* **Request URL:** The full URL requested (e.g., `http://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app/api/`).  This consistently points to a specific application.
* **IP Address and Port:** The IP address and port number of the server responding to the request (e.g., `169.254.169.126:49510`).

**Key Observations:**

* **Many 405 (Method Not Allowed) Errors:**  A significant portion of the requests are returning a `405` status code, indicating that the HTTP method used (likely `GET` in these cases) is not allowed for the specified URL.
* **Temporary Redirects (307):** Several `POST` requests result in `307` temporary redirects.
* **Consistent URL:** All requests target the same application endpoint (`/api/`) on the same server (`tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app`). This suggests debugging may focus on the application itself and/or its configuration, rather than network issues.
* **Client Identification:** The client making the requests is consistently identified as `python-reque` or once as `python-httpx`, suggesting a Python-based application is responsible.
* **Timing:** Response times are generally low, except for one entry with a 509ms response time. This could be an isolated incident or indicate a performance bottleneck.

In summary, the log shows a series of HTTP requests from a Python application to a specific server endpoint.  The frequent `405` errors point to a misconfiguration or bug in the server-side application's handling of HTTP requests, while the `307` redirects suggest a possible redirect loop or unintended routing.

**Image Description:** This image shows a form, likely an online submission form for a project.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Header:** "TDS Project 2 - Jan 2025" indicates the project name, number, and submission deadline.

* **Login Information:** The form notes that the user logged in with their `iitm.ac.in` email or work email.¬†The email address `22f3000819@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` was recorded upon submission.

* **GitHub Repository Link:** A section asks for the link to the GitHub repository containing the project's code. An example URL format is given, and the user has provided `https://github.com/RichPerspective007/tds_p2`.

* **API Endpoint Link:** A section requests the API endpoint URL. The user provided `https://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app/api/`.  It specifies that a POST request will be sent to this URL.

* **Submission Details:** The form indicates that only one response is allowed and that users can correct their responses before final submission.

The overall context suggests this is a project submission form for a course or assignment at an institution using the `iitm.ac.in` domain (likely the Indian Institute of Technology Madras).  The form collects essential project details, including the GitHub repository and API endpoint for the code and deployment respectively.

---

## Post #434 by carlton (Post ID: 616964)
We cant specify a clear deadline. If we could we would. At the present time there are roughly 100+ evals left in the pipeline. And we retry them to give students the best chance of getting a score. Sometimes we accomodate some unusual situations that we have been made aware of but all of those interrupt our workflows and so it takes time. Which makes this process a little unpredictable.


This is the first term where we have had students deploy solutions that require significant compute resources on our end to evaluate. So there was always going to be hickups. But i think that we have delivered an equally enriching learning experience as a result which is enough to land you an actual job. (Might not be so enriching on your CGPA admittedly, but thats a small price to pay for invaluable skills you hopefully have gained)

Normalisation is only helpful when no one scores the top marks.

**Image Description:** The image shows a webpage error message.  The prominent features are:

* **A stylized sad-faced folder icon:** This is a simple graphic representation of a file folder with X's for eyes and a sad mouth.  It visually communicates the error.

* **The text "Aw, Snap!":** This is an informal and attention-grabbing title for the error message.

* **The explanatory text "Something went wrong while displaying this webpage.":** This informs the user that there was a problem loading the page.

* **The error code "Error code: Out of Memory":** This provides a specific error code, indicating that the system ran out of available memory while attempting to render the webpage.  This is crucial for troubleshooting.

* **A hyperlink "Learn more":**  This is a clickable link, presumably leading to further information or troubleshooting steps regarding the "Out of Memory" error.

The overall impression is a friendly yet informative error message that clearly communicates the problem (memory issue) and offers a potential solution path ("Learn more").  The simple design keeps the focus on the key information.

This is a gentle reminder to kindly send the confirmation email indicating for whom the evaluation of Project 2 has been completed.


Additionally, I would like to confirm whether we can shut down our Azure VM after this, or if we should keep it running in case there is an additional evaluation. In one of the sessions, you had mentioned the possibility of offering alternate questions as a second chance for students, evaluated at half the original marking scheme (i.e., 2 marks per question).

Hello 
@Saransh_Saini
 , 
@Jivraj

Sir When i test it locally , my LLM is working fine , even running the app , it gave result in 2 sec ,

I dont know what happened in the logs , it was showing some runtime error ,

As i am using free plan of vercel , so it allow for 10 sec only ,

I think any heavy file being run , so it just take some more time , more than 10 sec , but inbuild feature of free plan allow to run only 10 sec ‚Ä¶ and thats why this happened , i guess


does it means , my LLM failed ??

Can you please try some other question , it will work , or even for heavy question it work ,

You can check its working from interface too

Please check once !!

**Image Description:** The image shows a Vercel function log, displaying information about the function's execution and a failed workflow.  Here's a breakdown of the key details:

**Left Panel (Logs):**

* **Vercel Function Logs:** Three log entries are displayed, showing the timestamps and descriptions of function events:
    * `00:11:07.064`: An email ID (23f1000598@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) was processed.
    * `00:11:07.112`: An email was updated in `index.html`.
    * `00:11:07.149`: A critical error occurred:  `Failed to trigger workflow: 401 ("message": "Bad credentials","documentation_url":"https://docs.github.com/rest", "status": "401")`. This indicates a 401 Unauthorized error likely due to incorrect credentials used to access a GitHub API.

* **Top Section (API Calls):**  Two API calls are visible, both POST requests to `/api/` on the `tds-ga-proj2.ve` domain.  One returned a 504 (Gateway Timeout) and the other a 307 (Temporary Redirect).

**Right Panel (Function Invocation & Deployment Information):**

* **Function Invocation:**
    * **Gateway Timeout:** A `504` gateway timeout error occurred, which implies the function execution exceeded a certain time limit.
    * **Route:** `/main.py` indicates the Python script executed.
    * **Location:** The function ran in a data center in Washington, D.C.
    * **Runtime:** Python 3.12 was used.
    * **Execution Duration:** The function ran for 10 seconds (out of a maximum of 10 seconds, indicating it hit the timeout).
    * **Memory Used:**  The function used 214 MB of memory (out of a maximum of 1024 MB).
    * **Response Finished:** This confirms the function's execution completed, despite the errors.

* **Deployment Information:**
    * **Deployment ID:** `dpl_EFXAUNYSadoksLSimpbQCo5jo_...` (truncated) uniquely identifies the deployment.
    * **Environment:** `production` confirms this is a live production environment.


**Overall:**

The logs reveal a problem with authenticating against a GitHub API (likely using incorrect credentials) which caused the workflow to fail. While the function completed its execution, it experienced a gateway timeout likely due to the failed authentication attempt and subsequent error handling. The error message suggests checking the API credentials for correctness.

**Image Description:** The image contains an email message addressed to "Dear Learner."  The main content is an important announcement regarding server endpoints for "TDS Project 2."  The sender is performing checks on these endpoints and requests that recipients who turned off their systems (because they were previously told evaluations were complete) to turn them back on.

The email apologizes for the inconvenience and explains that the evaluations are being completed as quickly as possible, acknowledging the cost of running systems on platforms like Azure.  The sender assures the recipient that they will be notified via email when the evaluation is complete, preventing unnecessary expense.  The email closes with "Kind regards."

Key terms and phrases include:

* **TDS Project 2:** This indicates a specific project the email is referring to.
* **server endpoints:** This suggests a technical aspect related to the project.
* **evaluations:** These are apparently in progress and require the systems to be running.
* **azure:** The mention of Azure suggests use of cloud computing resources.
* **credits:** The sender is aware that keeping the systems running costs credits, possibly a form of payment for cloud services.

The overall tone of the message is apologetic and informative.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/f/7/f7fcce09ffe413438bd869118c13e81187f0676f_2_690x364.png)

**Image Description:** This image shows a screenshot of what appears to be a Postman or similar API testing application.  Let's break down the visible elements:

* **Top Bar:**  The top bar displays "Untitled-1" and "Untitled Request," suggesting this is a new or unsaved request.  A URL, partially obscured but starting with "https://ds-pro...", is also visible in the address bar.

* **Request Method:** The "POST" method is selected, indicating that the request is designed to send data to a server.

* **Request Sections:**  The interface is divided into sections for configuring the request:
    * **Params:**  This section (partially visible) allows for adding query parameters to the request URL.  Currently, there are no parameters entered.
    * **Authorization:**  This section (not visible) is used to specify authentication details.
    * **Headers:** This section (partially visible) is used to specify HTTP headers. Currently, there are no headers defined.
    * **Body:** This section contains the request body.  The "JSON" view is selected, showing a JSON payload: `{"answer": "140"}`.  Other views ("Pretty," "Raw," "Preview") are available.
    * **Pre-request Script:** This section (not visible) allows for running JavaScript code before sending the request.
    * **Tests:** This section (not visible) allows for adding test assertions to validate the response.
    * **Settings:** This section (not visible) allows for various settings to configure the behavior of the request.

* **Response Section:** The lower portion, labeled "Test Results," displays the response from the server:
    * **Status:** Shows "Status: 200 OK," indicating a successful request.
    * **Time:** Shows the time taken for the request: 53.13s.
    * **Size:** Shows the size of the response: 361.8 bytes.


* **Buttons:**  Buttons for "Save" and "Send" are visible, along with others related to code and cookies (partially obscured).

In short, the image depicts a successful POST request to an API endpoint (`https://ds-pro...`), sending a JSON payload containing an "answer" of 140, and receiving a 200 OK response.  The partially obscured sections suggest additional configuration options within the application, but the core aspects of the request and its successful execution are readily visible.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/1/f/1f9185ba53d2b2112f0f71df1c2b7d94235f0428.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a terminal window displaying a `curl` command and its response. Let's break down the content:

**The `curl` Command:**

The command uses `curl` to send a POST request to a specific API endpoint (partially obscured in the image).  The request includes:

* **`-X POST`:** Specifies that the request method is POST.
* **`/api/` (partially obscured):**  This is the API endpoint URL. The rest is hidden.
* **`-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"`:** Sets the content type header for the request, indicating that data is being sent in multipart form data.
* **`-F "question=...`:** This is the key part.  It sends a question as form data.  The question is: "Let's make sure you can write formulas in Google Sheets. Type this formula into Google Sheets. (It won't work in Excel) =SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 5, 2), 1, 10)) What is the result?".  The question includes a Google Sheets formula.

**The API Response:**

The API responds with a JSON object:

* **`{"answer":"140"}`:**  This indicates that the API calculated the result of the Google Sheets formula ( `=SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 5, 2), 1, 10))` ) and found it to be 140.

**Additional Information:**

* The username `sahil` and machine name `DESKTOP-N2T75TO` are visible in the terminal prompt.
* The prompt indicates that the command was run from a user's terminal.


In summary, the image showcases an interaction with an API that evaluates a Google Sheets formula.  The formula's result, calculated by the API, is 140. The obscured part of the URL prevents a complete understanding of the API's purpose.

Just reply to the email that I have sent to you regarding your query. We will make exceptions for students facing this issue of having a changed end point due to the way ngrok works.

Humble Request to Update API Request Link


Dear Team,


I hope this message finds you well. I‚Äôm reaching out to kindly ask if it would be possible to update my API request link for project 2 in TDS. I realized that I mistakenly used the wrong endpoint in my earlier request.


Previous API Request Link:






project2llm-production.up.railway.app






IITM Assignment API - Swagger UI












Correct API Request Link:


https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/


https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/


Would it be possible for you to allow me to make this change, or kindly update the link on my behalf? I sincerely apologize for the confusion, and I‚Äôd be truly grateful for your support and understanding.


Thank you so much for your time and consideration.


Warm regards,

Pratyush Pulak Nishhank

**Image Description:** That's a logo.  The image depicts a stylized white lightning bolt inside a teal-colored circle.

* **Shape:** The overall shape is a circle.

* **Color:** The circle is a teal or turquoise color.  The lightning bolt inside is pure white.

* **Symbol:** The central feature is a simplified, angular lightning bolt. It's not realistic; it's a more abstract, graphic representation.  The bolt points upward and slightly to the right.

There is no text present in the image.  The image itself is the logo, and further information (like the name of the company or organization it represents) would need to be provided separately.

## Post #449 by 23f1000598 (Post ID: 617266)
But Sir please give some bonus , As in earlier terms , everyone got S grade in TDS , without doing anything , and from this term the difficulty level increased rapidly , just like e^x

Although I know that our LLM doesnt worked fully(100%) , but atleast they worked 50-60%

We have learned so many things  and try to implement in it too,‚Ä¶


Atleast give some bonus for our hardwork , and participating in both LLM project , so even we dont get S grade , but will get B , A , grade ‚Ä¶ and our CGPA doesn‚Äôt decrease much

because projects hold the major chunk in grading

Due to an unexpected power outage, my PC shut down abruptly, causing my local server and ngrok tunnel to terminate. When the system rebooted, I restarted the server and ngrok, which generated a new API endpoint as ngrok URLs are temporary and change with every session. The previous endpoint is no longer accessible, and the new one now serves as the API endpoint. I understand the need for a consistent URL and will explore solutions like reserving a domain through ngrok‚Äôs paid plan to prevent such issues in the future. Apologies for any inconvenience caused, and thank you for understanding.

Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Subject:** "[TDS Jan 25] Project 2 Announcement" - This indicates the announcement is from the TDS team, dated January 25th, and pertains to Project 2.

* **Sender:** 22t1 se2002 - This is likely a student ID or similar identifier.  The "to bcc: me" suggests the email is sent to multiple recipients with the recipient's email address hidden (blind carbon copied or BCC'd).

* **Recipient:** "Dear Learner" - Indicates the email is addressed to a student or a group of students.

* **Body:**  The main message is that the evaluations for Project 2 are complete. The student is given permission to "switch off your server now."  The email assures that the student will receive their Project 2 score once all evaluations are finalized.

* **Closing:**  A standard closing with "Thanks" and "Kind regards, TDS Team".

* **Timestamp:** "2:28 AM (18 hours ago)" -  Shows the time the email was sent.

In short, the email informs recipients that their Project 2 work has been assessed, they can shut down their systems, and their scores will be shared shortly.

Respected Course Team,


Harsh this side from NIT Allahabad, I am writing to inform you that I received a notification


image
2096√ó1154 160 KB

regarding an issue with my submission.


I believe the issue may have occurred because I had mistakenly provided an incorrect API endpoint in my earlier submission. However, my server is still actively running on Vercel


https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app

and the correct API endpoint is:


correct api : 
https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/


Everything else in the project is functioning as expected. I kindly request you to re-evaluate my submission using the correct endpoint as i am currently in my 3rd year of BTech Chemical engineering at NIT Allahabad and my placement session is coming so i don‚Äôt want to get failed in this course due to such a small mistake.


Thank you for your understanding and support.

**Image Description:** This is an email screenshot with the subject line "[TDS Jan 25] Important announcement regarding Project 2".  The email is from "22t1 se2002 <se2002@study.iitm.ac.in>" to the recipient.  The email's content is an important announcement regarding Project 2.


Key details include:


* **Urgent nature:** The email explicitly states "Please do not ignore this important announcement."

* **Project 2 evaluation:**  The announcement is related to server-side checks for Project 2 evaluations.

* **Action required:** Users who turned off their project due to prior communication indicating completion are instructed to "please turn them back on".

* **Apology and explanation:** The TDS Team apologizes for the inconvenience, explaining that they are completing evaluations and are aware that users are consuming credits on platforms like Azure.

* **Future communication:**  The team will inform users via subsequent emails once their evaluation is complete to prevent unnecessary resource usage.

* **Communication channel:** The email explicitly requests users NOT to reply to it and directs them to use Discourse for any further assistance.

The email also includes standard email features like reply and forward buttons, an unsubscribe link, and a timestamp indicating when the email was sent (2:26 AM, 20 hours ago).

**Image Description:** The image shows a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file displayed in a Google Colab environment.  The notebook contains Python code designed to solve a problem involving data from a zipped file.

Here's a breakdown of the key content:

* **The Problem:** The code addresses a challenge described in a JSON-like structure within the `data` variable. This challenge involves downloading a zip file (`q-unicode-data.zip`) containing three CSV and text files with different encodings (CP-1252, UTF-8, and UTF-16). Each file has two columns: "symbol" and "value". The goal is to find the sum of all "value" entries where the "symbol" is either 'O', 'R', or 'S' across all three files.

* **The Code:** The code includes:
    *  A URL (`url`) pointing to an API endpoint likely used to submit the solution.
    *  File handling: it opens the zip file (`q-unicode-data.zip`) in binary read mode (`'rb'`). The code appears to be missing the actual parsing and processing of the files within the zip archive.
    *  An API request: using the `requests` library to send a POST request to the specified URL, sending the zip file (`files`) and the problem statement (`data`) as data.
    *  Output: The code prints the HTTP status code (200, indicating success) and the response text, which contains the answer: `["answer":39961]`. This suggests the code successfully processed the data and found the sum to be 39961.

* **The Environment:** The top of the image shows the Google Colab URL and interface elements, confirming the notebook is running within the Google Colaboratory environment.

In summary, the image depicts a completed programming exercise that involved downloading, parsing, and processing data from files with different encodings to calculate a sum based on specific criteria, and submitting the solution to an API. The final answer, 39961, is clearly displayed.

**Image Description:** The image is an email, seemingly a technical communication.  Here's a breakdown of its content:

* **Header:** The email is titled "TDS P2 Endpoint".

* **Sender Information:** The sender is identified as "23F3004186 VISHNU KUMAR JHA" with an email address `<23f3004186@ds.study.iitm.ac.in>`.  A roll number, "23F3004186," is also visible.  A small image of a red car is present near the sender's information.


* **Recipient:** The email is addressed to "Saransh".

* **Body:** The email's body conveys a message hoping Saransh is well, then provides a public endpoint for a P2 API: `https://vishnu-dns.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api`. The sender requests feedback regarding any further issues.

* **Closing:** The email closes with a thank you from Vishnu Kumar Jha.

I just got the mail stating that my evaluation is complete and I can turn off my server.

However the Cloud Run logs show that all POST requests were made to the wrong end point.


The exact url I gave ends with ‚Äú/api/‚Äù but every POST request was either made to ‚Äú/api‚Äù which resulted in a 307 response or with ‚Äúhttp‚Äù instead of ‚Äúhttps‚Äù which resulted in a 302 response. Only the get requests were made to the correct endpoint but since the app was supposed to allow POST requests only, making GET requests just resulted in 405.

**Image Description:** The image shows a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Cloud Run logs page displayed on a mobile device.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Top Navigation Bar:** This shows a typical mobile browser's address bar with "cloud.google.com" prominently displayed. The time (12:16) and battery percentage (82%) are also visible.

* **GCP Interface:** The main part of the screen shows a table of Cloud Run logs. The interface clearly indicates it's within the Google Cloud console.¬†Specific sections include:

    * **Project:**  "millproject2hiva" is clearly labeled, indicating the GCP project name.
    * **Service details:**  This shows a link to more details about the service that produced these logs.
    * **Logs Table:**  This is the central area showing log entries. Each row contains a timestamp, log level, and a log message.  The log messages contain various details, including URLs, status codes (e.g., 200, 404), and potentially error messages.  The timestamps suggest the logs are from recent activity.
    * **Log Filters:** The interface provides tabs (Logs, Filters, etc.) indicating options to filter and manage the displayed logs.


* **Log Entries:** The logs themselves are extensive and contain technical information including timestamps, request IDs, response codes, and potentially detailed error messages. The specific content of the logs would need further investigation to understand the application's activity.


In short, the image shows a mobile view of a Google Cloud Run service's detailed logs, which would be useful for debugging and troubleshooting issues within the "millproject2hiva" project. The numerous log entries suggest a considerable amount of activity related to that application or service.

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of an email on a mobile device.¬†


The email's primary content is a request for an API endpoint URL.  It contains two key pieces of information:

1. **A GitHub link:** `https://github.com/RichPerspective007/tds_p2` This suggests a connection to a GitHub repository related to the project.

2. **A requested API endpoint URL:** `https://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app/api/` This is the crucial information being requested. The sender wants to ensure they can send POST requests to this precise URL.


The email also includes standard email reply options (Reply, Reply all, Forward), and a footer indicating that no add-ons are available for this email.  There are also icons for inbox, chats, and video recording at the bottom.  A notification shows 99 unread emails and 8 unread chats.  The top bar shows the time (12:23) and a battery indicator at 81%.

About 30 minutes ago, I received an email stating that project 2 has been evaluated. However, when I checked my IP stats, I found there is no special API access. You can verify this. I want to understand whether this is just a wrong email I received or if there is an issue with your system‚Äôs evaluation. Please clarify this doubt, as I am unable to focus on my final term exam.

**Image Description:** The image shows the output of a Python script (`uniu.py`) executed from a PowerShell prompt. The script appears to analyze network traffic and report on unique IP addresses that accessed a specific API endpoint.

Here's a breakdown of the information:

* **Command Execution:** The top line indicates the command executed: `PS E:\data science tool\main\grok> python uniu.py`.  This shows the script `uniu.py` was run in the `grok` subdirectory of a `data science tool` directory on the E: drive.

* **Summary:** The script found 5 unique IP addresses that accessed the `/api/` endpoint.

* **IP Address Details (Repeated 5 times):**  Each block contains:
    * **IP:**  The IP address (e.g., 43.230.106.157).
    * **Accessed endpoints:** The API endpoint accessed, which is `/api/` in all cases.
    * **API endpoint access count:** The number of times that specific IP accessed the `/api/` endpoint.

* **Totals:** At the end, it summarizes:
    * **Total /api/ endpoint calls:** The total number of calls to the `/api/` endpoint across all IP addresses (262).
    * **IPs accessing /api/ endpoint:** The number of unique IP addresses that made calls to the `/api/` endpoint (5).

* **Bottom Line:** The bottom line shows a number 71 which appears to be cut off.  This is likely additional information produced by the script but is not fully visible in the image.

In essence, this output provides a summary of API usage, identifying the source IP addresses and the frequency of their access to the `/api/` endpoint.  This could be used for monitoring, security analysis, or debugging purposes.

I checked my Vercel logs and saw that the requests were sent to the /api endpoint instead of the /api/ endpoint that I specifically gave in the google forms.


To confirm this I also sent a request to /api and /api/ enpoints and the /api gave a 404 error while /api/ gave a 200 message.

Dear Sir,

In my course dashboard, it shows project 2 status as absent, but i have already submitted the repo and api points well before deadline in the given forum. Still my vercel server is running and api is resolving as expected. Please look into this matter, because I already had issue in my project 1 and lost marks in that. Expecting a positive response from your end.

Hello Sir, my project 2 score is showing as 0. I had got email saying please update endpoint because earlier endpoint was having problems. I had sent 
https://c7f6-150-107-43-5.ngrok-free.app/api/
 as updated endpoint in google form on April 10th. Same day I had got around 9 requests on that endpoint around 4:56 PM. They were 200 OK requests on /api/ and 4 requests  were 307 redirect on /api. I presume they were from TDS team. Next day got email to shut off endpoint. I had tested endpoint locally and on ngrok. Both were fine. Was the updated endpoint in the google form evaluated? Was there some problem with the updated endpoint?

Namaste Sir. The projects have been quite challenging, and I have applied my knowledge to the best of my ability. I‚Äôve submitted the project but it‚Äôs showing 0 in the portal. Bonus marks for creating APIs and so in the projects would be greatly appreciated. I am planning to start my degree in the upcoming term, and this is the last subject I am completing at this level. So, I kindly request your assistance, sir.

@Saransh_Saini
 sir ,

I am writing to kindly request a re-evaluation of my Project 2 submission. As I had previously mentioned, the Render deployment link I submitted may take approximately 
50 to 60 seconds
 to activate upon the first load. This behavior is typical of free-tier deployments on Render, and I assure you that the application functions correctly in both 
Podman
 and 
Linux
 environments.


Upon reviewing my Render logs, I could not find any indication that the project was accessed or evaluated during the expected activation time. To ensure smooth accessibility, I have also deployed the same GitHub repository on 
Railway
 and submitted that link as well.


If possible, I kindly request either of the following:




Re-evaluation using the 
Railway link
 I provided, or


Re-evaluation using the 
Render link
, with allowance for the 50‚Äì60 second activation time.




Your consideration and understanding in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if any further clarification or information is needed.


Thank you for your support and guidance.

 I knew that this affected my project 2 score and that‚Äôs why I made that post(the one to which I‚Äôm replying in this message). Please look into this. My api is working and still on and will be on till 18th April when my credits will run out. Please re-evaluate my project 2 with the exact url I gave in the form. My project 2 was evaluated on the wrong url and this led to a zero in the project 2 score.

I need your immediate attention regarding my project-2, as I received zero marks, but my server is running completely fine. Below are the key points that I need you to look into:


 
Server is running and reachable. and Giving Correct Answers


 
GET and POST requests tested via Postman and VS Code
, both return 
200 OK
.


 
Tested on my laptop and by 10+ other people
 ‚Äì all received correct results.


 
No issues seen in logs or deployment
 ‚Äì everything was set up properly.


 
Others in my group got full marks
 ‚Äì we worked on the same project.


 
I have no idea what went wrong during the evaluation.


 
I‚Äôve spent weeks working on this project
, including sleepless nights.


 
This is my last term
 ‚Äì if I fail, I will have to repeat the entire diploma.


Please recheck my project thoroughly. Here are the important links for you to verify:




API Documentation:
 
FastAPI - Swagger UI


API Endpoint:
 
http://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api




I truly believe that my server is functioning as expected, and I just need a re-evaluation to confirm that.


I‚Äôve put in a lot of effort into this, and I sincerely request that you review it again.

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a web browser window displaying a serial console for a virtual machine (VM) within Microsoft Azure.  The top shows the Azure portal URL. The main content is a terminal window showing a Linux session.

**Key details:**

* **Azure Portal:** The browser's address bar clearly shows the user is working within the Microsoft Azure portal.  The URL indicates a specific resource.

* **VM Name:** The title bar clearly identifies the virtual machine as "shashitdsproject2".

* **Serial Console:** The left sidebar indicates that the view is a "Serial console", a direct text-based interface to the VM's operating system.

* **Python Code (Top):** At the top of the terminal window is a small snippet of Python code, which appears to be a simple function designed to process a request.

* **Command History:**  A significant portion of the terminal shows a history of commands executed on the VM. The commands appear to be related to:
    * Restarting Nginx.
    * Managing a Uvicorn service (a Python ASGI web server).  The `systemctl` commands show that the `uvicorn` service is running, loaded, and enabled.
    * The output shows Uvicorn has started successfully and is running on a specific host and port.

* **System Status of `uvicorn`:**  The output of `systemctl status uvicorn` provides key information, including that the service is "active (running)" and indicates the process ID (PID), memory usage, and CPU usage.

* **Log Messages:** Following the `systemctl` commands are the log messages from the Uvicorn service startup, including warnings and informative messages about its operation (e.g., the warnings about missing libraries).  These timestamps show the service started around 09:35 on April 14th.

* **Error Messages:** There's an error message indicating a "sudo: command not found". This suggests a potential issue with the VM's configuration or user privileges.

**Overall:**  The screenshot suggests the user is troubleshooting or deploying a Python web application (possibly FastAPI, given the log messages) running on a Linux-based virtual machine in Azure. The `sudo` error and the systemctl commands to restart Nginx hint at the user potentially working through deployment or configuration problems.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/0/4/04546b4805d006ee2763bce3c3d8f1fb9f5eae1f_2_690x387.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a web page, likely a tool for testing APIs.  Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Top Bar:**  A standard browser tab bar is visible, showing several tabs (My Dash, Graded A, TDS 2025, etc.) and the URL of the current page: `shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs/default/process_request_api_post`. This indicates the page is interacting with an Azure cloud service.

* **API Testing Interface:** The main content shows an API testing interface.  There are sections for:

    * **Execute and Clear:** Buttons to execute the API request and clear the input field.
    * **cURL Request:** A `curl` command is shown, specifying a POST request to a specific URL (`https://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api/`). The headers indicate it's sending data as `multipart/form-data` and expecting a JSON response.  The request's data is partially visible and mentions querying data about GET requests for pages under `/malayalammp3/` between specific times on Saturdays.
    * **Request URL:** Displays the URL of the API being called, matching the URL in the `curl` command.
    * **Server Response:** This section displays:
        * **Code:**  `200`, indicating a successful response.
        * **Response Body:** A JSON response is partially visible, showing `{"answer": 5082}`.  The full response is hidden but can likely be downloaded.
        * **Response Headers:** Various headers are listed from the server's response including important ones like `access-control-allow-credentials`, `content-type`, `date`, and `server`.
    * **Responses (bottom):** This section appears to be a table for storing results, though it's empty in the screenshot.

* **Download Button:** A download button allows the user to save the entire response.

In summary, the image depicts the process of making an API request to a server hosted on Azure. The request is designed to retrieve the number of successful GET requests for a specific set of pages on Saturdays. The server responded successfully (code 200) with a JSON response containing a numerical answer.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/a/b/ab704a5f91397ecaefad0c7b700fbf487e6a4e92_2_690x457.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of the Postman application, a popular API development environment.  Let's break down the visible elements:

**1. Postman Interface:** The main area displays a new HTTP request being constructed.  The method is set to `POST`, and the URL points to an Azure cloud service: `shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs`.

**2. Request Details:**

* **URL:**  The target URL is clearly visible.  This indicates the request is targeting a specific endpoint likely for API documentation.
* **Method:**  `POST` is selected.
* **Params:**  The "Query Params" section is empty. This means no query parameters are being sent with the request.
* **Headers:**  The "Headers" section shows (0) indicating no headers have been added yet.
* **Body:** This is where the request body is defined. It's currently using the `HTML` view and shows code that includes a `<script>` tag. This script loads the Swagger UI library from a CDN (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swagger-ui-dist@5/swagger-ui-bundle.js`).  Below this `<script>` is JavaScript code which configures Swagger UI: defining the URL to the OpenAPI specification (`/openapi.json`), the ID of the div element where the UI is rendered (`#swagger-ui`), and the layout (`BaseLayout`).

**3. Response:** At the bottom, the "Test Results" section shows that the request has been sent and received a `200 OK` status code.  The response time (286 ms) and size (1.11 KB) are also displayed. The response body itself is not fully visible.

**4. Left Sidebar:** The left sidebar shows the standard Postman workspace elements, including collections and the ability to add new requests.  A "New Collection" is listed as "empty".

**5. Top Bar:** The standard window title bar is visible, indicating a program called Postman is running.

**In Summary:** The screenshot captures a moment where a user in Postman is making a POST request to an API endpoint to load a Swagger UI for API documentation.  The `200 OK` response confirms the successful retrieval of the necessary data to render the API documentation interface.  The JavaScript code in the body helps dynamically render the UI.

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of the Postman application, a popular API development environment.  Let's break down the key elements:

**1. Postman Interface:**  The main window displays a typical Postman interface.  The left-hand side shows the workspace, collections, and the option to add a new request.

**2. HTTP Request Details:** The central area shows the details of an HTTP GET request.  Specifically:

* **URL:** The request targets `http://localhost:8000/api` and the full URL is `shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs`. This suggests it's interacting with a backend service potentially hosted on Azure.
* **Method:** The request method is GET.
* **Params, Authorization, Headers, Body, Pre-request Script, Tests, Settings:** These tabs allow for configuring various aspects of the request.  The `Headers` tab appears to have some defined headers, though the contents aren't visible.
* **Query Params:** This section is currently empty, meaning no query parameters are being sent with the request.

**3. Response:** The bottom part shows the response from the server.

* **Status:** The request returned a `200 OK` status code, indicating a successful request.
* **Response Time and Size:**  The response time was 247 milliseconds, and the size was 1.11 KB.
* **Response Body:** The "Body" tab shows the response content displayed as HTML.  This response contains a `<div>` with the ID "swagger-ui" and includes a `<script>` tag that loads the Swagger UI bundle from a CDN (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swagger-ui-dist@5/swagger-ui-bundle.js`). This indicates that a Swagger UI interface is being used for API documentation.

**4. Javascript Code:** A portion of Javascript code is displayed, suggesting it's configuring the Swagger UI. This snippet initializes the Swagger UI using the  `SwaggerUIBundle`, specifying the URL (`/openapi.json`) for the API specification, the DOM element ID (`#swagger-ui`), and the layout (`BaseLayout`).

**In summary:** The image depicts a Postman session making a GET request to an API endpoint. The response includes the code for embedding the Swagger UI, a common tool for interactive API documentation. The request appears to be fetching an OpenAPI specification (`/openapi.json`) to render this documentation in the browser. The use of `localhost` and an Azure URL suggest potential development or testing of an API.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/a/8/a8f24f1e596a1ae98e2ac6e1a450aea01922a6b9_2_690x430.jpeg)

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a web browser window displaying the results of an API request.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the key content:

* **Top Bar:** A standard browser address bar shows a URL related to an Azure Cloud App service (`shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs#/default/process_request_api_post`).  There are also browser controls (back, forward, refresh, etc.) visible.

* **cURL Request:** A section displays a `cURL` command used to make the API call.  The command includes headers specifying the `accept` type as `application/json` and `Content-Type` as `multipart/form-data`, and sends a question asking for a GitHub Pages URL.

* **Request URL:** Clearly displays the API endpoint that was called: `https://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api`.

* **Server Response:** This section details the server's response to the API request.

    * **Code:** Shows the HTTP status code `200`, indicating success.
    * **Response Body:**  Displays the JSON response containing the `answer`: `"https://shashikumarkohir.github.io/my-portfolio/"`. This is the GitHub Pages URL that the API call returned.
    * **Response Headers:** Contains the HTTP headers returned by the server.  Important ones include `access-control-allow-credentials: true` (allowing credentials to be sent), `access-control-allow-origin` (specifying the allowed origin for CORS), the `content-type` which confirms the response is JSON, and the date and server information.

* **Bottom Section:** Shows sections labeled "Responses", "Code", and "Description," along with a search bar.¬†A "Download" button is visible near the response body.

* **Taskbar:** A Windows taskbar is visible at the bottom of the screenshot showing various applications.

In short, the image documents a successful API call to retrieve a GitHub Pages URL. The response body provides the URL, and the headers show important information about the API response and its configuration.  The `cURL` command shows exactly how the request was made.

**Image Description:** The image shows a web page with a form for submitting a question.  The form is centered on a white background.  At the top of the form is the title "Submit Your Question". Below the title, there are two input fields:

1. **Question:** A large text box for typing in the question.

2. **Upload ZIP File (optional):**  A smaller text box with a "Choose File" button next to it.  Currently, the text "No file chosen" is displayed, indicating that no file has been selected.

At the bottom of the form is a blue button that says "Submit". This button presumably sends the question and any uploaded file to a server.

The URL in the browser's address bar shows that the page is hosted on Vercel (`tdsproject2.vercelapp/api/`).  This suggests it's a backend API endpoint for handling question submissions.  The overall design is simple and functional.

**Image Description:** This image shows a Python script interacting with a FastAPI server to process a SQL query.  Let's break down the key features:

**1. Python Script (Lines 1-12):**

* **`import requests`:** Imports the `requests` library, essential for making HTTP requests.
* **`url` variable:** Contains the URL of the FastAPI server ("http://16.16.189.187:8000/tdsp2").  This is likely a locally running server based on the IP address.
* **`data` dictionary:** Defines the data to be sent in the POST request.  Crucially, it includes a `question` key containing an SQL query that asks for the total sales of "Gold" ticket types. This is a natural language query which is then processed.
* **`files` dictionary:** Contains a CSV file ("q-fastapi.csv") located in the user's Downloads directory ("C:/Users/suneh/Downloads/q-fastapi.csv").  This file seems to contain the `tickets` table data referenced in the SQL query. The file is sent with the request.
* **`response = requests.post(url, data=data)`:** Sends a POST request to the FastAPI server with the `data` and `files`.

**2. Terminal Output (Lines 14-18):**

* **`PS C:\Users\suneh\lab5> python burima.py`:** Shows the command executed in the PowerShell terminal, running the Python script named `burima.py`.
* **`Status Code: 200`:** Indicates a successful HTTP response from the server.
* **`Response JSON`:** Displays the JSON response from the FastAPI server.  The crucial part is the `"answer"` key, which contains the generated SQL query:  `"SELECT SUM(units * price) AS total_sales FROM tickets WHERE LOWER(TRIM(type)) = 'gold';"`.  This shows that the server successfully processed the natural language SQL query into a proper SQL statement.

**In summary:** The image depicts a workflow where a natural language SQL question is sent to a FastAPI server along with a CSV file. The server processes the natural language question, generates a proper SQL query, executes the query against the provided CSV data, and returns the result.  The success of the process is evident in the `Status Code 200` and the returned SQL statement.

**Image Description:** The image shows a text-based log, likely from a web server.  The log entries consist of alternating INFO and WARNING messages.

* **INFO messages:** These lines show successful connections or requests, including the IP address and port number of the connecting client, the HTTP method (GET or POST), the requested URL path, the HTTP version, and the HTTP status code.  Most of the INFO lines show 404 Not Found responses, indicating the server could not find the requested resource. One INFO line shows a "200 OK" response, indicating a successful request.

* **WARNING messages:** These lines indicate invalid HTTP requests received by the server.  They don't provide details about the nature of the invalid request.

* **Relevant features:** The consistent structure of each log line allows for easy analysis of client requests and server responses.  The log is useful for monitoring server activity, identifying potential problems, and analyzing client behavior.  The high number of 404 errors suggests that there may be issues with the server's configuration or with clients sending incorrect requests.  The presence of a "favicon.ico" request is common, as web browsers often automatically request this small icon file.


In short, the image is a snippet of a web server log displaying a series of HTTP requests, mostly resulting in "404 Not Found" errors, interspersed with warnings about invalid requests.  The log is valuable for diagnosing server-side or client-side issues.

**Image Description:** The image contains a snippet of Python code using the FastAPI framework.  Let's break down the code:


* **`@app.post("/tdsp2")`**: This is a FastAPI decorator. It indicates that this function (`tdsp2`) is an endpoint that handles POST requests to the URL `/tdsp2`.

* **`async def tdsp2(...)`**: This defines an asynchronous function named `tdsp2`.  The `async` keyword suggests it's designed to handle potentially long-running operations without blocking other parts of the application.

* **`question: str = Form(...)`**: This defines a parameter named `question`. It's expected to be a string (`str`) and will receive its value from the HTML form data (`Form(...)`). The `...` indicates that it's a required parameter (it must be provided in the request).

* **`file: Optional[UploadFile] = File(None)`**: This defines a parameter named `file`. It's optional (`Optional[...]`) and will receive an `UploadFile` object if a file is uploaded.  `File(None)` sets a default value of `None` if no file is provided in the request. `UploadFile` is likely a type provided by the FastAPI framework or a related library for handling file uploads.

In summary, this code defines a FastAPI endpoint that accepts POST requests, expecting a text question from an HTML form and optionally a file upload.  The function likely processes the question and the optional file (if provided).  The endpoint's URL is `/tdsp2`.

## Post #516 by 24f1002359 (Post ID: 619156)
I noticed that my  Project 2  status is currently marked as  ‚ÄúAbsent‚Äù in the course dashboard. However, I would like to clarify that I **submitted the GitHub repository and Vercel API link well before the deadline

via the designated forum.


Additionally, my 
Vercel server is still active
, and the API is functioning correctly, which can be verified here:


 
API Form Submission


I also have a 
response copy from the forum confirming my submission
, including both the GitHub and Vercel links, as proof. I kindly request you to review this and take the necessary steps to update my project status.

**Image Description:** The image shows a Google Form, specifically page 5 of 118.¬†


The form contains two main sections:

1. **GitHub Repository Link:** This section asks for the link to a GitHub repository containing the code for "Project 2".  It provides an example format and a text box for the user to input the actual link.  The provided link is `https://github.com/itskaiffazal/tdsproject2`.

2. **API Endpoint Link:** This section requests the link to an API endpoint. It emphasizes the need for an exact URL to which a POST request can be sent. The provided link is `https://tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/`.

At the bottom, there's a standard Google Forms footer mentioning the ability to create your own Google Form and a link to report suspicious forms.  A red asterisk (*) next to the questions indicates they are required fields. The top navigation bar indicates typical Google services integration icons.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/3/e/3eb72913606e2d5777075f5876d1198eda100359_2_690x345.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a web page with a form for submitting a question.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Title:** "Submit Your Question" is prominently displayed at the top of the form.

* **Question Field:** A large text box labeled "Question:" is provided for users to type their question.

* **File Upload:** An optional file upload section is present, labeled "Upload ZIP File (optional):". A "Choose File" button allows users to select a ZIP file from their computer.  Currently, the status shows "No file chosen".

* **Submit Button:** A bright blue button labeled "Submit" is at the bottom of the form, enabling users to send their question (and optionally, the uploaded file).

* **URL:** The browser's address bar shows a URL which indicates the form is hosted on Vercel: `tdsproject2.vercelapp/api/`. This suggests the form likely interacts with a backend API for processing submissions.


The overall design of the form is simple and straightforward, consistent with a standard online question submission system.

@Jivraj

I need your immediate attention regarding my 
project-2 , as I received zero marks,
 but 
my server is running completely fine
. Below are the key points that I need you to look into:


Server is running and reachable. and Giving The Correct Answers


GET and POST requests tested via Postman and VS Code, both return 200 OK.


Tested on my laptop and by 10+ other people ‚Äì all received correct results.


No issues seen in logs or deployment ‚Äì everything was set up properly.


Others in my group got full marks ‚Äì we worked on the same project.


I have no idea what went wrong during the evaluation.


I‚Äôve spent weeks working on this project, including sleepless nights.

Cant have least scores despite all the efforts.


Please recheck my project thoroughly. Here are the important links for you to verify:


API Documentation: 
FastAPI - Swagger UI


I truly believe that my server is functioning as expected, and I just need a re-evaluation to confirm that.

I‚Äôve put in a lot of effort into this, and I sincerely request that you review it again.

Please don‚Äôt ignore this.

Thanks,

**Image Description:** The image shows a web page displaying the results of an API request.  Here's a breakdown of the key content:

* **URL Bar:** The address bar shows the URL `bhavanaproj2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs/default/process_request_api_post`, indicating a request to a specific API endpoint.

* **"Execute" and "Clear" Buttons:** These buttons are likely used to send the API request and clear the displayed results, respectively.

* **"Responses" Section:** This section contains the results of the API call.

* **"Curl" Section:** This shows the cURL command used to make the API request. Key details include:
    * `-X POST`: This specifies a POST request.
    * The URL: `https://bhavanaproj2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api` (truncated in the image but the full URL is shown in the "Request URL" section below)
    * Headers:  `Accept: application/json`, `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` which indicate the expected response format and the data type being sent.
    * A partially visible comment that indicates this is part of an initiative involving API integration and data retrieval using the BBC weather API.

* **"Request URL" Section:**  This confirms the full API endpoint used: `https://bhavanaproj2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api`.

* **"Server response" Section:** This section provides information about the server's response.
    * **Code:** Shows the HTTP status code `200`, indicating a successful request.
    * **Details:** This section seems to be empty.
    * **Response body:** This is a JSON object containing a key "answer" which maps dates (YYYY-MM-DD) to weather descriptions (e.g., "Sunny and light winds", "Thundery showers and a gentle breeze"). This is the core data returned by the API call.

* **"Response headers" Section:** This section is visible but empty, indicating that no header data was returned (or at least isn't displayed here).

* **"Download" Button:** A button to download the response data.


In summary, the image depicts a successful API request to a weather API, likely part of a larger project or task involving API integration. The API response provides a JSON object mapping dates to weather conditions for a given period.  The displayed information strongly suggests a testing or development environment.

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a web application interface, likely a testing or debugging tool.  The interface is predominantly light green and white.

**Key features:**

* **Input Section:**  At the top, there's an input area labeled "question" (type: string), which is marked as required. Next to it is a text field with instructions: "Let's make sure you can write formulas in Google Sheets. T...".  Below that is a "file" input to upload a file (type: string or binary).  A checkbox labeled "Send empty value" is also present.  A blue "Execute" button initiates the process. A "Clear" button is for resetting the input fields.

* **Output Section:** Below the input area, the "Responses" section displays the results.

* **Curl Command:** A pre-filled `curl` command is shown in a dark gray box. This command makes a POST request to a specific URL (`https://bhavanapro.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api`), including headers for `Accept`, `Content-Type`, and the question itself. The question is a prompt asking the user to test a Google Sheets formula `SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 9, 11), 1, 30))`.  The command shows that the question is being sent as a multipart form data.

* **Request URL:** The URL to which the request is being sent is displayed separately. This URL is the same as the one in the curl command.

* **Server Response:** This section contains the server's response to the request. The "Code" shows a status code of 200 (OK), indicating a successful request. The "Response Body" shows a JSON object with the key "answer" and the value "695".  A "Download" button is present.

**In summary:** The application appears to be designed to test a user's ability to write and use formulas within Google Sheets by submitting a formula via an API request. The server processes the formula (likely evaluating it) and returns the result.  The `curl` command is likely provided as an example for users to test the API from their own command line.  The result (695) is the result of the Google Sheets formula calculation.

**Image Description:** Here's a description of the image's content:

The image shows a close-up view of a MacBook's screen and keyboard.  The screen displays a terminal window showing network activity, likely from a web application or API testing session.

**Key features on the screen:**

* **Top Section:** This section displays connection details including the user's name ("Gaurav Ghodge"), plan ("Plan: Free"), version number ("3.22.0"), location ("India (in)"), and two URLs.  One URL is a local address ("http://127.0.0.1:4040") and the other appears to be a ngrok URL, which suggests a temporary public URL for local development.  The ngrok URL is partially cut off, but the visible part is:  `https://c7f6-159-107-43-5.ngrok-free.app-x`.  Network statistics (ttl, opn, rt1, rt5, p50, p90) are also displayed.

* **Middle Section (Requests):**  This shows a list of HTTP requests, each line indicating the time, method (POST), URL (/api or /api/), and response code. The majority of requests to `/api` and `/api/` are resulting in `307 Temporary Redirect` responses, with a few showing `200 OK`. This suggests the application is redirecting requests, and the purpose of the test is checking the status codes.


* **Bottom Section:** This is a blurred image of the macOS desktop showing a colorful gradient background and dock icons.  The dock icons are not clearly visible but appear to represent commonly used applications.

**Keyboard:**

A portion of a black MacBook keyboard is visible at the bottom, with standard function keys (F3-F8) and number keys (4-8) are clearly visible.


In summary, the image depicts a developer likely testing an API using ngrok,  and the terminal output provides details of the requests and responses, confirming redirects or successes.  The specific details of the API are partially obscured, but its functionality is apparent through the observed HTTP request/response data.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/7/6/766817c29b6f57416237d09036f8dd55a0e8d0d8_2_690x400.jpeg)

**Image Description:** The image shows a screen capture of a code editor, specifically VS Code, displaying a Python FastAPI project.

**Key features:**

* **File Explorer (left):**  This section lists the project files and folders.  Relevant files include `main.py` (the main application file), `file_handler.py`, `functions.py`, `openai_client.py` (suggesting interaction with the OpenAI API), `Answers.json` (likely storing responses), `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `requirements.txt`. The folder structure hints at a well-organized project.

* **Code Editor (center):** The central area shows the `main.py` file. The code imports necessary libraries (FastAPI, OS, typing, etc.) and sets up CORS middleware, indicating the API is designed to be accessible from different origins.  A crucial function `process_question` is defined, accepting a question (string) and an optional file (presumably for file uploads).  The annotations suggest it's an asynchronous function.

* **Terminal (bottom):** The terminal window shows a `curl` command used to test the API endpoint `/api/`. The command includes the `-F question` flag, which sends a question as part of a multipart/form-data request.  The output displays the API's response ({"answer": "1121"}), suggesting a successful interaction.  The question sent is about calculating the number of Wednesdays within a specified date range.

* **Other details:** The top-right corner indicates the language is Python and the version is 3.13.2.  The status bar at the bottom displays the file name, line number, column number, and other VS Code information.

**Inferences:**

This appears to be a Python-based API built with FastAPI that processes questions, possibly involving external services like OpenAI, and can handle file uploads. The `curl` command in the terminal demonstrates testing of the API's functionality.  The application likely involves some form of question-answering or natural language processing, given its interaction with the OpenAI client. The `Answers.json` file might store previously asked questions and responses.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/0/0/00183e58c3ad6ac1e6589f66025a4f813af1873e_2_690x400.jpeg)

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a macOS computer screen.  The main content is split between two windows:

**Left Window:** This is a file explorer view, likely within a code editor like VS Code, showing a project directory structure.  Key folders include:

* `app`:  Suggests a web application.
* `utils`: Likely contains utility functions.
* `tests`: Contains test files for the project.
* `Answers.json`: Implies the project involves generating or storing answers to questions.
* `README.md`: A standard file providing project information.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists project dependencies.
* `server.py`:  Indicates a server-side component to the application.

The `main.py` file is open and shows the beginning of a Python FastAPI application, importing modules for handling files, HTTP requests, and OpenAI (likely for integrating with a language model).

**Right Window:** This is a terminal window displaying a `curl` command.  The command makes a POST request to a `ngrok` URL (`https://4109-150-187-43-123.ngrok-free.app/api/`), sending data including a question:  "How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1986-06-06 to 2008-01-29?". The response received is  `("answer": 1121)`, which suggests the application successfully calculated and returned the number of Wednesdays within that date range.  The `ngrok` URL suggests this is a locally running web application exposed to the internet via ngrok, a tunneling service often used during development.  The terminal also shows the user is `gauravghodge`.

In short, the image depicts a Python developer working on a web application that uses a language model (possibly OpenAI) to answer date-related questions.  The `curl` command demonstrates testing the application's functionality.

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a web browser window displaying a Microsoft Azure portal.  The main focus is on a serial console showing a Linux terminal session.

**Key Elements:**

* **Azure Portal:** The top portion shows a standard Azure portal address bar, indicating the user is working within a Microsoft Azure cloud environment.  The title bar shows tabs for other applications.

* **Serial Console:**  The bulk of the screenshot shows a serial console window.  This suggests remote access to a virtual machine hosted on Azure.  The window title indicates the project name (`shashitdsproject2`).

* **Terminal Commands and Output:** The terminal shows several commands and their output:
    * Python code (a function definition named `process_request`).
    * System commands using `sudo` (e.g., `systemctl restart nginx`, `systemctl daemon-reload`, `systemctl start uvicorn`, `systemctl enable uvicorn`). These suggest managing services on the virtual machine (nginx web server and a uvicorn process, likely a Python ASGI server).
    * Output from `systemctl status uvicorn`: This shows the uvicorn service is active and running, including PID, memory usage, and CPU usage.
    * Log output from the uvicorn process: showing startup messages and warnings.  These warnings might indicate missing dependencies (like ffmpeg).
    * Command errors indicating that the `sudo` command was not found in one instance but worked in others. This is indicative of a permission issue or possibly an environment setting problem.

* **Side Panel:** A side panel on the left shows typical Azure virtual machine controls including:  `console`, `Connect`, `Help`, `Boot diagnostics`, and `Serial console`.

In summary, the image captures a troubleshooting session on an Azure virtual machine, potentially involving a web application using uvicorn and nginx. The user is attempting to restart and enable these services, encountering and addressing some minor issues along the way. The partial python code snippet suggests a web application is being used. The overall context is the management and debugging of a Python web application deployed on Azure.

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a web page, likely a testing or debugging interface for an API.  The main content is organized into sections:

* **Top Bar:**  A standard browser address bar shows a URL pointing to an Azure cloud service (`shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs/default/process_request_api_post`). Multiple tabs are visible, suggesting other browser windows are open.

* **API Request Section:**  Prominently features an "Execute" button and a "Clear" button. Below it, a "Curl" section displays a cURL command used to send a POST request to a specific API endpoint.  The request includes headers specifying the accepted content type (`application/json`), content type (`multipart/form-data`), and a description in the request body hinting at data retrieval about GET requests for pages under `/malayalammp3/` on Saturdays between 15:00 and 22:00.  The "Request URL" is displayed separately.

* **API Response Section:**  Displays the server's response to the API request.  
    * **Code:** Shows a status code `200`, indicating a successful request.
    * **Response Body:** A JSON response is partially visible, showing a key-value pair `{"answer": 5082}`.  A "Download" button suggests the full response body can be downloaded.
    * **Response Headers:** Shows a list of HTTP response headers, including information about access control, content type, length, date, and server.

* **Bottom Section:** Contains "Responses" with "Code" and "Description" labels, along with a "Links" section (content not visible).


In summary, the image documents the process of making a POST request to an API, showing the request parameters and the server's JSON response with HTTP headers. The context suggests this is a development or testing environment involving API interaction and data retrieval. The number 5082 in the response body likely represents a count related to the query described in the request.

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of the Postman application, a popular API development environment.  The main focus is on a POST request being made to the URL `shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs`.

**Key Details:**

* **HTTP Request:** A POST request is being sent.  The URL indicates that the target is likely an API endpoint for documentation (possibly Swagger/OpenAPI documentation).

* **Request Body (HTML):** The body of the request contains HTML code.  This code includes a `<script>` tag that loads the Swagger UI bundle from a CDN (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swagger-ui-dist@5/swagger-ui-bundle.js`).  This suggests that the API documentation is likely being rendered using the Swagger UI framework.  There is also a JavaScript snippet that configures the Swagger UI,  setting the URL to `/openapi.json`, the DOM ID to `#swagger-ui`, and the layout to `BaseLayout`.

* **Response:** The response at the bottom shows a status of `200 OK`, indicating that the request was successful. The response size is 1.11 KB and it took 286 milliseconds.

* **Postman Interface:** The screenshot clearly shows the typical Postman layout including sections for:
    *  Request Method (POST)
    *  URL
    *  Parameters
    *  Authorization
    *  Headers
    *  Body
    *  Cookies
    *  Pre-request Script
    *  Tests
    *  Settings

* **Other Details:** There are also other elements of the Postman interface visible, like the "My Workspace" section and a "New Collection" section, suggesting this is likely an active development environment.

In short, the image depicts a developer using Postman to load Swagger UI documentation for an API hosted on Azure. The `/openapi.json` endpoint suggests that the API provides its definition in the OpenAPI specification.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/c/7/c7f55da5f7b8a633a3011ceafacbe4431b176be5_2_690x466.png)

**Image Description:** This image shows a screenshot of the Postman application, a popular API development environment.  Let's break down the visible content:

**1. Postman Interface:** The main window displays a typical Postman interface for creating and sending HTTP requests.  The left panel shows collections and requests. The central area shows the details of the current HTTP request being prepared.

**2. HTTP Request Details:**

* **URL:** The request URL is `http://localhost:8000/api` and targets a backend service found at `shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs`.  This indicates it's likely a GET request to retrieve documentation (potentially OpenAPI/Swagger specification).
* **Method:** The HTTP method is set to `GET`.
* **Tabs:**  Tabs across the top show options for Params, Authorization, Headers, Body, Pre-request Script, Tests, and Settings.
* **Query Params:**  This section is empty, implying no query parameters are being used.
* **Body:** The "Body" tab shows a `Raw` view of a piece of HTML/Javascript code. The code suggests the response is likely intended to render a Swagger UI interface.

**3. HTML/Javascript Code in the Body:** The most important part of the screenshot is the HTML and Javascript code snippet in the "Body" tab.  It does the following:

* **Includes Swagger UI:** The code dynamically includes the Swagger UI library via a `<script>` tag from a CDN (Content Delivery Network) `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swagger-ui-dist@5/swagger-ui-bundle.js`.  This indicates that the application uses Swagger UI for API documentation visualization.
* **Initializes Swagger UI:** After including the library, Javascript code initializes Swagger UI, specifying:
    * `url: '/openapi.json'` : this is the path to the OpenAPI specification file.
    * `dom_id`:  The HTML element where the UI will be rendered.
    * `layout`:  Specifies the UI layout.

**4. Response Information:** At the bottom, the "Test Results" section indicates a successful response: `Status: 200 OK`, with a response time of 247ms and size of 1.11KB.

**In Summary:** The image depicts a developer using Postman to fetch an OpenAPI specification (likely `/openapi.json`), which will be used to display interactive API documentation using the Swagger UI library.  The `localhost` URL suggests local development, while the Azure URL shows where the API will be deployed.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/a/8/a8f24f1e596a1ae98e2ac6e1a450aea01922a6b9_2_690x430.jpeg)

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a web browser displaying the results of an API call.  Here's a breakdown of the key content:

* **Top Bar:** A standard web browser address bar showing a URL related to an Azure Cloud App service (`shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs#/default/process_request_api_post`).  Various browser extensions/icons are also visible.

* **Curl Command:**  The top section displays a `curl` command used to make the API request. This command includes headers specifying the acceptance of JSON data and the content type as `multipart/form-data`, and it sends a question asking for a GitHub Pages URL.

* **Request URL:** This section clearly shows the API endpoint the `curl` command targets: `https://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api`.

* **Server Response:** This section displays the server's response to the API request.

    * **Code:** Shows the HTTP status code, `200`, indicating a successful request.
    * **Response Body:** Displays the JSON response containing the answer: `"answer": "https://shashikumarkohir.github.io/my-portfolio/"`. This is the GitHub Pages URL requested.
    * **Response Headers:** Displays various headers returned by the server, including information about allowed credentials, origins, content type, date, server details, and caching directives.  The `access-control-allow-origin` header specifically allows requests from the Azure Cloud App service URL.


* **Bottom Sections:** The bottom part of the image has sections for viewing more responses and a search bar, with some standard windows icons present at the very bottom.

In summary, the image documents a successful API call that retrieves a GitHub Pages URL.  The details of the API request, response (including headers and status code), and the requested URL are all clearly visible.

**Image Description:** The image shows a Google Form on a mobile device.  The form is divided into sections, each asking for specific information:

1. **Email Confirmation:** This section confirms the submission of a work email address (partially obscured, but ending in `@ds.study.litm.ac.in`).  It notes that only one response is allowed and that corrections can be made before submission.

2. **GitHub Repository Link:** This section requests the link to a GitHub repository containing the code for "Project 2".  An example format is provided, and the user has entered a link: `https://github.com/Sakshi6749/PROJECT2`.

3. **API Endpoint Link:** This section asks for the link to an API endpoint. It emphasizes the need for a precise URL that will accept a POST request.  The user has provided a URL: `saakshi-llama.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com`

4. **Footer:** The footer contains standard Google Forms options, allowing the creation of a new form and reporting suspicious forms.


The overall context suggests this form is part of a project submission process, likely for a class or assignment involving software development.  The requested information points to code hosted on GitHub and an API endpoint for testing or deployment.

**Image Description:** This image shows a student's progress report for a "Tools in Data Science" course.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Header:** The top section displays "Tools in Data Science" as the course title, with "NEW COURSE" indicating it's a recently started course. The background is a dark maroon with a textured pattern.

* **Weekly Assignments:** A list shows the scores for each weekly assignment.  Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5 have numerical scores (92.50, 90.00, 100.00, 100.00 respectively), while weeks 3, 6, and 7 are marked as "Absent".

* **Average Assignment Score:**¬†The average score of the assignments is clearly stated as 96.00.

* **Programming Quiz and Course Project:** The report includes scores for a programming quiz (90.00) and a course project (5.00). A second course project score is listed as "Absent".

* **End Term Exam Eligibility:** The report confirms the student is "Allowed to take End Term Exam?". The answer is "Yes".

* **Call to Action:** A button at the bottom reads "Go to Course page >", directing the user to access more information about the course.

In short, the image provides a concise summary of a student's performance in a data science course, highlighting their scores and eligibility for the final exam.

---

You were not present in the form Anand gave us. It most likely because you submitted after the deadline (or made edits after the deadline, if the form he shared allowed edits).

I‚Äôm writing to clarify the status of my  Project 2, which is currently marked as ‚ÄúAbsent‚Äù. I would like to respectfully state that I 
submitted the form before the deadline
 ‚Äî specifically on  31st March 2025 at 22:11 , and I have the  response copy as proof.


I would also like to emphasize that:


No edits were made to the form after submission.

I  did not make any changes to the project or submission after the deadline.

My  Vercel API is still active  and functioning as expected.


Here are the submitted links:


 GitHub Repo: 
GitHub - itskaiffazal/tdsproject2: Tools in data science Project 2 - TDS Solver


 API Endpoint: 
https://tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/


I kindly request you to review my submission  and take the necessary steps to update the status.

**Image Description:** Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a Google Forms email confirmation.¬†


**Key Elements:**

* **Gmail Header:** The top shows the Gmail logo and header.  The recipient's email address (kaiffaza1001@gmail.com) and name (Kaif Fazal) are visible in the upper right.  The email's timestamp (31 March 2025 at 22:11) is also present.

* **Email Subject:** The subject line clearly states "TDS Project 2 - Jan 2025".

* **Google Forms Confirmation:**  A prominent purple Google Forms banner is displayed.  Below it, a message reads, "Thanks for filling in TDS Project 2 - Jan 2025". This confirms the submission of a form.  A line follows, stating "Here's what was received."

* **Action Button:** A button labeled "Edit response" provides the option to review and potentially modify the submitted form.

* **Sender Information:** The email is from Google Forms (forms-receipts-noreply@google.com), which is standard for automatic form response notifications.  The "To" field shows the recipient's email address (kafaza001@gmail.com).  Note that there's a slight discrepancy between the "To" address and the recipient shown at the top; this might be due to a typo or different email aliases.

In summary, the image provides evidence that a Google Form titled "TDS Project 2" was submitted by Kaif Fazal on March 31st, 2025. The confirmation email allows the user to edit their response if needed.

**Image Description:** This image shows a portion of an email displayed within a Gmail interface.¬†The main content is a Google Form embedded within the email, containing two key questions:

1. **GitHub Repository Link:**  This section asks for the link to a GitHub repository containing the code for "Project 2."  An example URL format is provided (`https://github.com/username/repository-name`), and a user has inputted a specific URL: `https://github.com/itskaiffazal/tdsproject2`.

2. **API Endpoint Link:** This section requests the link to an API endpoint, emphasizing the need for an exact URL that can receive POST requests.  The user has provided this URL: `https://tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/`.

The bottom of the form includes a standard Google Forms message encouraging users to report if the form appears suspicious.  The email client shows navigation buttons (Reply, Forward) and the page number indicator "7 of 134," indicating this is part of a longer email thread or form.  Standard Gmail email header elements (reply, forward, etc.) are also visible.

**Image Description:** The image shows a web page with a simple form for submitting a question.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Header:** The title "Submit Your Question" is prominently displayed at the top of the form.

* **Question Field:** A large text box labeled "Question:" is provided for users to type their question.

* **File Upload:**  An optional field allows users to upload a ZIP file. It displays "No file chosen" initially, indicating that no file has been selected.  There is a "Choose File" button to browse for a file.

* **Submit Button:** A blue button labeled "Submit" is at the bottom of the form to send the question and optional file.

* **URL:** The browser's address bar (partially visible) shows a URL that appears to be a Vercel deployment ("tdsproject2.vercelapp/api/"). This suggests that the form is part of a backend API for a web application.

In short, the image depicts a user interface element designed to collect user questions, optionally with supporting files, which are then likely processed by the backend API indicated in the URL.

You used your personal email address while filling the form. It is impossible for us to track who is submitting a form if you do not use your official email id. Unfortunately we cannot evaluate your submission.

**Image Description:** This is an email to a learner, identified as "22t1 se2002," regarding a re-evaluation of their server endpoint for a project (P2 Evaluations).  The email states that due to a low score on a previous evaluation, a re-evaluation will be conducted.

**Key details:**

* **Time:** The server endpoint needs to be turned on from 11:00 PM to 2:00 AM TONIGHT.  The email was sent at 5:01 PM, indicating a one-hour window before the server needs to be active.
* **Endpoint Testing:** Only the endpoint submitted in the official forms will be tested. Endpoints submitted via discourse or email will be ignored.  If an updated endpoint was submitted in a recent form, that will be used; otherwise, the previous endpoint will be tested.
* **Endpoint URL:** The specific endpoint URL being tested is provided: `https://e95b-2405-201-e04b-d085-9cf5-4f92-fe5a-309e.ngrok-free.app/ask`


The email is formal and clearly instructs the learner on what action needs to be taken and which endpoint will be evaluated.  The inclusion of the timestamp and the endpoint URL are crucial elements to properly understand and act upon the email's content.

**Image Description:** The image shows a mobile phone screen displaying a conversation or form, likely within a messaging or collaborative application.  The main content consists of two key questions:

1. **GitHub Repository Link:** This section requests the link to a GitHub repository containing the code for "Project 2."  An example format is provided (`https://github.com/user-name/repository-name`). The respondent has provided a specific link: `https://github.com/kartikayy1/project2final`.

2. **API Endpoint Link:** This part asks for the link to the API endpoint, emphasizing the need for a functional POST request to that exact URL. The provided link is: `https://project2final-beta.vercel.app/`.

Below these questions, a message about creating a Google Form and reporting suspicious forms is visible. The reply section at the bottom indicates multiple unread messages (99+).  The top bar shows standard mobile phone indicators, including time, Wi-Fi signal, and app navigation icons. The overall theme is dark.

Dear Sirs,


I apologize for the inconvenience caused by reaching out again. I came to know that many students have received an email stating that the re-evaluation for Project 2 will be conducted today between 11 PM and 2 AM. However, I have not received any such communication on my end.


I would like to bring to your attention that I actively helped several peers deploy their servers on Vercel and resolve various issues, and many of them received marks as high as 80. Unfortunately, my own record still shows as ‚ÄúAbsent,‚Äù despite the fact that I submitted the Google Form well before the deadline and my server has been live and running for over two weeks.


For your verification, I am attaching screenshots of my GitHub repository and the Vercel deployment dashboard, which clearly show the deployment.


I sincerely request you to kindly consider this issue. This situation has caused significant mental stress, especially as I had already faced a grading issue in Project 1. The anxiety and uncertainty around my Project 2 score have negatively affected my focus during the end-term exam and viva for other projects as well. Receiving a zero in this project would only further impact my overall performance and morale, despite the genuine effort I have put in.


I genuinely hope for a positive response and a fair re-evaluation.


Thank you very much for your time and understanding.

**Image Description:** This image shows a screen capture of a Git repository's file list, likely from a platform like GitHub or GitLab.  Let's break down the visible content:

**Top Section:**

* **`tds_proj2f Public`**: This is likely the name of the repository ("tds_proj2f") and indicates it's a public repository.
* **`main`**: Shows the currently selected branch.
* **`1 Branch 0 Tags`**: Indicates there's one branch and zero tags in the repository.
* **`Go to file`**:  A search bar to quickly find a specific file within the repository.
* **`Add file`**: A dropdown menu to add new files to the repository.
* **`Code`**: Another dropdown menu, likely for viewing the code in various formats.
* **`Unpin` and `Unwatch`**: Buttons to remove the repository from a user's pinned or watched items.

**Main Section (File List):**

This section lists the files within the repository, each with:

* **A file icon:**  A small icon indicating it's a file.
* **Filename:**  The name of each file, suggesting various file types:
    * `.env` (environment variables file)
    * `.gitignore` (a file specifying files to ignore during Git operations)
    * `GA1.html` (likely an HTML file)
    * `LICENSE` (a license file)
    * `README.md` (a Markdown file describing the project)
    * `download.png` (an image file)
    * `ga1.py`, `ga2.py`, `ga2_6.py`, `ga2_9.py` (Python files)
* **`final commit`**:  Indicates the status of each file, suggesting these are the final versions committed to the repository.
* **Timestamp:** Each file shows "2 weeks ago", meaning all these files were last committed two weeks before the screenshot was taken.
* **Commit Hash (top line only): `21f2000304`**: This is a shortened commit hash (SHA), unique identifier of the most recent commit. The `2e818b2` on the right is also part of the commit hash.
* **`1 Commit`**: This indicates the number of commits made in the shown time range


**In summary:**  The image shows a snapshot of a Git repository containing a small number of files, all of which have been finalized with a commit two weeks prior to the screenshot being taken. The repository appears to be related to a small program, possibly consisting of several Python files alongside supplementary documentation, configurations, and images.

Respected Sir,

Sir I made a mistake while submitting the GFORM in hurry, I submitted the deployment URL instead of API URL:

currently for re-evaluation my URL that I received on my mail id is:


https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/


but for API testing we need to add /api/ to the URL so final URL is:


https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/api/


I‚Äôm sorry for this mistake sir, please accept this small change, we just need to add /api/ to the URL


Thank you


actually 2 of my friend had submitted similar url with no /api/ but he got 80 marks and I also submitted without /api/ url but I got 0 so for re evaluation sir please add /api/ to the original URL as mentioned Above Please Sir

**Image Description:** The image shows a Google Forms confirmation email on a mobile device.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the key information:

* **Subject:** "TDS Project 2 - Jan 2025" This indicates a form related to a project named "TDS Project 2" with a January 2025 deadline.

* **Sender:** "Google Forms - forms-receipts -noreply@google.com" This is a standard automated email from Google Forms.

* **Recipient:** "24ds1000119@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" This is the email address of the person who completed the form.  The address suggests a connection to the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM).

* **Date:** "31 Mar 2025, 11:47 pm" The form was submitted on March 31st, 2025.

* **Email Body:** The email confirms the submission of the form and includes a message: "Thanks for filling out TDS Project 2 - Jan 2025. Here's what was received."¬† It also has a button labeled "Edit response," allowing the recipient to review and potentially modify their answers if needed.

* **Security:** The email indicates "Standard encryption (TLS)," assuring the recipient that the communication was secure.

* **Bottom Icons:** The bottom of the screen shows standard email app icons: a mail icon (with 99+ unread messages), a chat icon (with 4 unread messages), and a video call icon.

In short, the image confirms the successful submission of a Google Form named "TDS Project 2 - Jan 2025" by a user associated with IITM.

**Image Description:** The image shows a web form interface, likely part of a website or application called "TDS GA Solver."  The form's purpose is to allow users to submit questions and optionally upload files to receive a response.

Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Title:**  The title at the top clearly states "TDS GA Solver". This suggests the tool solves problems related to TDS and GA (the meanings of which would need further context).

* **Question Input:** A large text box is labeled "Ask a GA Question:" with a placeholder "Type your question here...".  Users are expected to enter their question in this box.

* **File Upload (Optional):**  Below the question box, there is a file upload section.  It says "Upload File (Optional):" indicating that uploading a file is not required but permitted. A "Choose File" button is provided;  currently, it shows "No file chosen."

* **Submit Button:** A prominent purple button labeled "Submit" allows users to send their question and any uploaded file.

* **Response Area:**  Finally, there is a large, blank text box labeled "Response:". This is where the application is expected to display the answer after the user submits the form.

In short, the image depicts a simple, user-friendly interface for submitting queries and obtaining solutions, potentially by processing the question text and any associated file.  The specific functionalities of "TDS" and "GA" are unclear without further information.

So anyone with an ngrok endpoint can send their new ngrok to us, but obviously you will need to start the server up much sooner than 11 in that case. An email will be sent to you specifically. DO NOT give us the endpoint on discourse. Reply to the email we will send specifically for you.

Request to Use Public DNS for Course Tool API Deployment or Use Alternate Endpoint


Dear 
@Jivraj
 
@Saransh_Saini
 
@carlton


I hope you‚Äôre doing well!


I‚Äôm currently running my server and  trying to access the API hosted at:


https://sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app/api/



However, I‚Äôm encountering the following error:


curl: (6) Could not resolve host: sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app



After some investigation, I found that the issue is related to DNS resolution. The API becomes accessible when using 
public DNS services
 like 
Google (8.8.8.8)
 or 
Cloudflare (1.1.1.1)
. This suggests that the current deployment environment may be using a restricted or unreliable DNS resolver, which causes access issues on some networks (e.g., Jio).




 Suggested Fix:


To ensure reliable access for all students, could you please consider updating the deployment or testing environment to use a 
public DNS
 provider?


Recommended options:




Google DNS
: 
8.8.8.8
, 
8.8.4.4


Cloudflare DNS
: 
1.1.1.1
, 
1.0.0.1




This can typically be configured via Docker settings or the environment‚Äôs networking configuration.




 Alternate Option:


If the DNS change isn‚Äôt possible at the moment, I kindly request that you evaluate my project using the 
previously deployed endpoint
 instead:


https://tds-project-2-pnlm.onrender.com/api/



Please note that this endpoint may take 
50 to 60 seconds
 to respond, as it‚Äôs hosted on a platform with a cold start delay ‚Äî but it is fully functional and provides the correct outputs.


Both endpoints are currently active and return identical results.




Thank you so much for your time and support ‚Äî I truly appreciate the effort you‚Äôre putting into helping us succeed in this course!


Best regards,


Sahil Raj

In the google form which we submitted I had pasted the API endpoint as the one which I got in the vercel dashboard i.e. 
https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/

whereas the correct api for giving post requests has 
/api
 added to the above which i forgot to add. i.e**.
https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/api/**

I have checked again and the post requests are working.

I know that I made a mistake in the form and regret the same. If possible, please evaluate my project 2 with  the above endpoint

## Post #626 by Algsoch (Post ID: 620453)
Hi Jivraj,


I would like to draw attention to a specific question regarding the process of creating an HTML file and publishing it to GitHub. I notice that I am not providing a preloaded answer when this question arises. Instead, it creates a new repository and an HTML file, then deploys it on GitHub. Initially, it presents a URL, but I understand that your server checks to verify whether the URL contains valid HTML. This verification process takes time, which can lead to an incorrect response when checking the URL right after deployment.


At that moment, the URL might not display the HTML content or be verified by your server, even though eventually, the deployment is successful and the URL is correct. Please keep in mind that publishing to GitHub requires some time; it‚Äôs not feasible to expedite this process drastically, to my knowledge.


I checked and noted that this question has been asked recently.


Additionally, I believe the image may show your server‚Äôs IP address.


Thank you!

**Image Description:** The image shows a Windows PowerShell window displaying a log of actions, likely related to a data science tool.  The log entries show timestamps, IP addresses, file paths, HTTP requests, and scores/confidence levels.

**Key Observations:**

* **IP Address:** The IP address `103.158.43.22` appears repeatedly, suggesting a single source is making multiple API calls.
* **File Paths:** The log repeatedly references files within a directory structured like  `E://data science tool//GA[Number]//[filename.py]`.  This suggests a system for organizing Python scripts, potentially related to different stages or aspects of the data science process (GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4 likely represent different tasks or projects).
* **HTTP Requests:**  Multiple `"POST /api/ HTTP/1.1" 200 OK` entries indicate successful POST requests to an API endpoint.
* **Scores and Confidence:** The log entries for some files (e.g., `second.py`, `third.py`) include scores and confidence levels (e.g., "score: 0.41, confidence: 40%"), suggesting these files may be related to some kind of model prediction or analysis, possibly scoring the quality or reliability of the results.
* **Application:**  The log mentions `tds_app` which is likely the name of the application being used.  
* **Data Sources:**  Mentions of `openai`, `github`, and `excel` suggest that data is being sourced from these platforms.

**In summary:** The image depicts a log of an application (`tds_app`) accessing an API from an IP address (`103.158.43.22`) to process data sourced from various sources (OpenAI, Github, Excel). The application is processing data using Python scripts organized in a structured manner. The log provides information about the status of the operations (successful API calls) and the performance metrics (scores and confidence levels) related to specific parts of the process.

Sir, I had submitted the project on 31st March at 11:30 PM itself. However, I made a change to the Vercel endpoint and updated it on 1st April. I can provide a screenshot of the Vercel deployment as proof. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt keep a copy of the Google Form submission. But to be honest, I shared the deployed project with some of my friends on 1st and 2nd April, after my edit, and they submitted it through the form after me. They received marks, but I haven‚Äôt received the same.

---

## Post #646 by afsalshah (Post ID: 620495)
Sorry, Sir. I just realized the reason why my submission was not considered ‚Äî I had used the email ID I created specifically for my MAD2 project. It was a genuine mistake on my part. However, I noticed in a previous thread that another student who submitted using a different email ID was given a chance to update it. I kindly request you to consider giving me the same opportunity as well.

I have given my endpoint to the gform circulated in this thread.

---

## Post #647 by Jivraj (Post ID: 620496)
We didn‚Äôt account for such cases. The purpose of that form was to reevaluate only those who submitted using their IITM email but had provided the wrong endpoint.


Anyone who didn‚Äôt use their IITM email during submission‚Äîeven if they later filled out the form‚Äîwas filtered out and not considered for reevaluation.

**Image Description:** The image contains a list of items that appear to be grades or scores from a course.  The items are:

* **PROGRAMMING_QUIZ_1 - Absent:** This indicates that the student was absent for Programming Quiz 1.

* **COURSE PROJECT - 35.00:** This shows a score of 35.00 for a course project.

* **Course Project Score 2 - 0.00:** This indicates a score of 0.00 for a second course project.

The text is formatted simply, with the item name and its corresponding score or status separated by a hyphen. The scores are numerical, representing a likely grading system on a scale where 35.00 may be out of a possible higher value.  The absence is noted simply with "Absent."

Yesterday, I received a mail stating that our 
Project 2
 would be 
reevaluated between 11 PM and 2 AM tonight
, and that the following endpoint would be used to test the API:


 
https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/


However, I have not seen any logs in Railway during that timeframe, and my score on the dashboard is still showing as 
0

**Image Description:** The image shows a screen capture of a mobile device displaying a Google Form or similar application.  The form appears to be requesting specific URLs from a user.

The most important content is in two sections:

1. **GitHub Repository Link:** This section asks for the link to a GitHub repository containing code for "Project 2".  It provides an example of the expected URL format and then requests the actual URL: `https://github.com/kartikayy1/project2final`.

2. **API Endpoint Link:** This section requests the URL for the user's API endpoint. It emphasizes that a POST request should be able to be sent to this exact URL. The provided URL is: `https://project2final-beta.vercel.app/`.

At the bottom, there's a standard reply section of the form, an indication of a 99+ unread message notification, and a "Does this form look suspicious?"  report option, suggesting the form may have been part of a submission process.  The time displayed at the top of the screen is 18:59.

**Image Description:** This image shows a screen capture of a mobile phone displaying a form or message related to updating URL endpoints.  Here's a breakdown of the key content:

**Top Section:**

* **Time and Network Status:**  The top shows the time (1:16 PM) and a low network speed (0.1KB/s).
* **Email/Form Explanation:**  A message explains that the form is designed to streamline the process of updating URL endpoints and accommodating grievances.  It indicates that the user's email address (partially visible: 2311002643@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) was recorded when they initially submitted the form.

**Middle Section (Main Form):**

* **Updated Endpoint Request:**  This section directly asks the user to provide their updated endpoint.
* **Instructions:**  Clear instructions emphasize that if the endpoint changes again, the user should edit this existing form rather than submitting a new one to avoid confusion and maintain the latest information.
* **Endpoint URL:** A URL is given: `tds-ga-lim.vercel.app/api`. This is likely the address where the updated endpoint information needs to be submitted.

**Bottom Section:**

* **Google Form Options:**  It shows options to "Create your own Google Form" and a "Report" option in case the form appears suspicious.
* **Navigation Icons:**  Standard mobile navigation icons are visible, including email, chat (with a "10" notification), video recording, and other unidentified icons.

**Overall:**

The image documents a process for updating URL endpoints through a simple form, emphasizing the importance of using a single form for changes. The form is likely used within an organization or project based at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (iitm.ac.in based on the email address).  The `vercel.app` URL suggests the form might be hosted on a serverless platform.

Yes, the new page took about 5‚Äì10 seconds to go live after the GitHub repository was created when we used Gmail as a parameter.

If the Gmail is fixed, we can hardcode it in advance.

In our case, Gmail is a parameter, so the function should remain dynamic and it would take 5-10 second to go live after we received answer.

I have completed and submitted the assigned project 2, and I have verified that it is working correctly as per the given instructions.


However, I noticed that the score awarded to me for the project is 0. I believe this may be an error, as my project meets the required criteria and functions as expected.


I kindly request you to review my submission and let me know if there was any issue during evaluation or submission that may have led to this result.


I have deployed the project on vercel as instructed.

I have uploaded all the links in google form and submitted it.


To support this, I am attaching a screenshot of the PowerShell window that shows an example of my application running successfully for one of the questions.

**Image Description:** The image shows a command-line interface (CLI) session, likely from PowerShell, interacting with a web server.  Here's a breakdown of the content:

**Top Section:**

* **Copyright Notice:**  A standard copyright notice for Microsoft Corporation.
* **PowerShell Upgrade Prompt:**  An instruction to install the latest PowerShell for improved features, including a link to Microsoft's website.
* **HTTP Request:** A command using the `http` utility (likely a PowerShell module) to send a POST request to a specific URL (`https://tds-solver-lyart.vercel.app/api/`). The request includes a parameter `"question="`, suggesting the purpose is to submit a question for processing by the server.
* **Google Sheets Formula Instruction:** The command includes a challenge to write a specific Google Sheets formula (`=SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 15, 7), 1, 10))`).  This formula is meant to be typed into Google Sheets to calculate a result.  The instructions explicitly state that it won't function correctly in Microsoft Excel.

**Middle Section:**

* **Server Response:** The CLI displays the server's HTTP response (status code `200 OK`), followed by various HTTP headers.  These headers provide information about caching, content type, date and server details.  The `X-Vercel-Cache: MISS` indicates that the response was not served from a cache.  The `X-Vercel-Id` header shows a unique identifier associated with the server-side request processing.

**Bottom Section:**

* **JSON Response:** The server responds with a JSON object containing the answer (465) and the status ("success") of the operation.  This suggests the server successfully processed the formula within the question, and `465` is the result.


**Key Features:**

* **URL:** `https://tds-solver-lyart.vercel.app/api/` This is the crucial URL the PowerShell script is communicating with.  It's likely a web service designed to solve mathematical problems or process Google Sheets-like formulas.
* **Formula:** `=SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 15, 7), 1, 10))` This is the key formula. Understanding this formula would reveal the mathematical problem being solved.
* **Result:** `465` The server's answer to the question posed by the formula.
* **JSON Structure:** The structured JSON response is indicative of a RESTful API interaction.


In summary, the image documents a PowerShell script that submits a mathematical formula to a web service for processing. The service returns the calculated result in JSON format. The use of Google Sheets functionality indicates that the formula is likely designed for array-based operations.

@Jivraj
 I appreciate the team incorporating my updated response at the endpoint with the ‚Äú/api‚Äù path and re-evaluating accordingly, as well as sharing the results via email.


To my surprise, when I invoke the same endpoint that was evaluated ‚Äî using the correct multipart/form-data payload with both question and file fields ‚Äî I consistently receive a 200 OK response with the expected output.


Moreover, if I omit either field from the form-data, the server returns the exact validation error mentioned in the re-evaluation report, which makes sense. Based on this behavior and the details in the shared report, I‚Äôd like to confirm: during the re-evaluation, was the request payload indeed sent with both question and file fields included in the form-data?


For reference, I‚Äôve attached a screenshot demonstrating the response.

**Image Description:** The image shows a JSON-formatted log, likely from an automated testing process.  The log consists of several repeated blocks of data, each representing a single test.  Let's break down the key features:

* **Repeated Structure:** The log is composed of five identical structures (indicated by the curly braces `{}`). Each block contains the following key-value pairs:

    * `"api"`: This string consistently points to the same API endpoint: `"https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/"`. This suggests that all tests are interacting with the same API.

    * `"test_code"`: This field uniquely identifies each test.  Examples include "GA1_q18", "GA4_q6", "GAZ_q3", "GA3_q2", and "GA5_q7". The naming convention might indicate a grouping (e.g., "GA" could be a group identifier) and a question number (e.g., "q18").

    * `"status"`:  Every test listed shows a `"FAILED"` status.

    * `"error"`: The error message is consistent for all tests: `"HTTP 400: {\"error\":\"Missing question or file\"}"`. This strongly suggests a common problem across all test runs - either a question or a required file was absent for each test case.

* **Overall Indication:** The log clearly indicates a series of failed API tests, all caused by a missing question or file. The repeated nature of the failure suggests a problem with the test setup or the data provided to the API, rather than a random issue within the API itself.  The consistent API endpoint implies that the problem likely lies in how the tests are being executed or in the files/data that should be associated with each `test_code`.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/c/4/c4e8e2ee7ed548a59a61566b1d0d2b6c52b0bd4e_2_690x332.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a web application interface, likely a tool for testing APIs.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **API Endpoint:** The top line displays the API endpoint URL: `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`.  A POST request is being made to this URL.

* **Request Body:** The section labeled "Body" shows the request parameters. The user has selected "form-data" as the encoding type. Two key-value pairs are present:
    * `question` (unchecked): This key is empty, indicating no question was provided in the request.
    * `file` (checked): This key contains a file named `abcd.zip`.

* **Request Description (Annotated):**  A red annotation, "Sending request without Question," highlights the fact that the crucial `question` parameter is missing.

* **Response:** The "Test Results" section displays the response from the server. The response code is `400 Bad Request`, indicating an error. The response body shows a JSON object containing an error message: `"error": "Missing question or file"`.

* **Response Description (Annotated):**  A red annotation, "Response same as evaluvation," points to the error message in the response, showing that the error response matches the expected error related to missing data.

* **Other features:**  The interface provides options for Authorization, Headers, scripts and settings  The lower part shows timing and size information about the response.

In short, the image demonstrates a failed API call due to missing required parameters in the request (`question`). The response correctly reflects this error, showing that the API works as expected in handling invalid requests.

**Image Description:** This image shows a screenshot of a web application, likely a tool for testing APIs.  The main focus is on a POST request being sent to the endpoint `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`.

**Key Elements:**

* **URL:** The URL `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/` is prominently displayed at the top, indicating the target API.
* **Request Method:** A POST request is being used.
* **Body:** The request body is shown in the "Body" tab.  The method used is `form-data`.  There is a text input field for a `question` (checked), and a file input field for a `file` (unchecked).  The `question` field contains the text "What is the value in the "answer" column of the...".  The `file` field shows a file named "abcd.zip".
* **Response:** The "Test Results" section shows a `400 Bad Request` response with the JSON error message: `{"error": "Missing question or file"}`.  The response time (774 ms), size (433 B), and other metadata are displayed.
* **Annotations:**  The screenshot is annotated with red arrows and text explaining the actions taken and the results observed.  Specifically, "Sending req without file" highlights that the request was sent without a file, which leads to the error response indicated by "response same as evaluvation report".

**In summary:** The image demonstrates an API test where a request was sent without selecting a file, despite including a question. This omission resulted in a "400 Bad Request" error, indicating that both question and file are required.  The error message confirms this requirement.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/d/1/d16ed1d7d739a3779a907f08137a1f4626a1aee2_2_690x337.png)

**Image Description:** This image shows a screenshot of what appears to be a Postman or similar API testing tool.  The user is making a POST request to the API endpoint `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`.

Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Request:** The request is using the `form-data` method and includes two key-value pairs in the body:
    * `question`: A text field containing the question "What is the value in the "answer" column of the...".
    * `file`: A file upload field containing a file named `abcd.zip`.

* **Expected Result:** The user is expecting a 200 OK response code (indicated by the annotation "Expected res code"). The actual response code received is also 200 OK, and the response time and size are displayed (868ms, 410B).

* **Response:** The actual response from the server is shown in JSON format.  It contains a single key-value pair: `"answer": "1234567890"`.  This is annotated as "Expected response", suggesting this was the anticipated result.

* **Annotations:**  The image includes several annotations clarifying the image's contents and the user's expectations (shown in red):

    * **"Sent req with file/question both"**: This confirms that both the 'question' and 'file' were included in the sent request.
    * **"Expected res code"**:  Points to the expected HTTP status code (200 OK).
    * **"Expected response"**: Highlights the expected JSON response from the server.


In essence, the image demonstrates a successful API test where a file and a question were sent as part of a request, and the server returned an expected response code and data.  The test appears to be validating the ability of the server to process both a file and a text query and return the correct answer.

I would like to highlight an issue regarding the evaluation of the TDS Solver Project 2.






As per the official project instructions, our API was clearly required to handle 
POST
 requests at /api/ with multipart/form-data.






Nowhere in the documentation was it mentioned that the API should handle 
GET
 requests.






However, during evaluation, GET requests seem to be made to the endpoint, leading to 
405 Method Not Allowed
 errors.






These errors are expected behavior for an API that is properly built to accept only POST, exactly as per the project guidelines.






Therefore, I request that the evaluation team 
only test using POST requests
 as originally instructed.






Penalizing students because of unnecessary GET requests would be 
unfair and incorrect
 based on the project requirements.






Please ensure that evaluation happens strictly according to the provided instructions.

**Image Description:** The image contains two JSON-like objects, each representing a test result.  Key features are:

* **`api`:** This field contains the same URL in both objects: `https://tds-solver-bml0qi7k5-adityas-projects-07f86c8b.vercel.app/`. This suggests a common endpoint or API being tested.

* **`test_code`:** This field identifies the specific test run.  One test is labeled `GA1_q18` and the other `GA4_q6`, implying different tests or variations of the same test.

* **`status`:** Both tests have a `status` of `"FAILED"`.

* **`error`:** This field contains the error message.  Both error messages are identical and indicate an HTTP 405 error ("Method Not Allowed").  The error message also includes an HTML snippet suggesting the API returned a formatted HTML error page instead of a plain JSON response. The HTML snippet itself shows a title and a heading saying "405 Method Not Allowed".  The paragraph explains this means the HTTP request method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) used was not allowed for that specific URL.

In short, the image shows the results of two failed API tests. Both tests failed due to the server responding with a "Method Not Allowed" (HTTP 405) error, indicating an issue with the HTTP method used in the request.  The fact that both tests share the same `api` field and error message suggests a problem with the API endpoint itself, rather than a problem specific to individual tests.

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of an API testing tool, likely Postman or a similar application.  The user is testing a POST request to the endpoint `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`.

**Key features:**

* **Request Body:** The request body uses `form-data` and includes two key-value pairs:
    * `question`:  "What is the value in the "answer" column of the ..." (The question is truncated) - This is a text field.
    * `file`: `q-move-rename-files.zip` - This is a file upload, specifically a zip file.  A red arrow points to this, indicating the user intentionally uploaded a zip file without a CSV.

* **Response:** The server returned a `400 Bad Request` error. The response body contains a JSON object with a single key-value pair: `"error": "No CSV file found in zip."`  A red arrow highlights this error message.

* **User Annotation:** The user has added handwritten annotations to clarify the test:
    * "Changed the zip file which doesnt having any CSV." This explains the purpose of the test - to check how the API handles a zip file lacking a CSV.
    * "Got the expected error response :)"  This indicates that the test successfully produced the anticipated error, confirming the API's expected behavior.

In summary, the image documents a successful API test designed to verify the API's error handling when processing a zip file without a CSV file inside.  The test passed because the API correctly returned a "No CSV file found in zip" error.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/f/8/f8ba75a5c899794a86005120ac8d0af1dba85cf0_2_690x324.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a web application, likely an API testing tool.  The main focus is on a POST request being made to the URL `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`.

Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **API Endpoint:** The URL `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/` is prominently displayed, indicating the target of the HTTP POST request.

* **Request Body:** The request body is formatted using `form-data`. It contains two key-value pairs:
    * `question`:  A text field with the value "What is the value in the "answer" column of the ..."  This appears to be the question being asked.
    * `file`: A file upload field containing a zip file named `abcd.zip`.  A red arrow points to this, with accompanying text indicating this zip file was updated with a new CSV file containing a different value.

* **Response:** The "Test Results" section shows a successful response (`200 OK`) with a size of 410 bytes. This response is displayed as JSON, containing a key-value pair `"answer": "3812934199"`. A red arrow points to this, with accompanying text "Got expected answer."  This shows the test passed, providing the anticipated value from the updated CSV inside the ZIP.

* **Annotations:**  Handwritten annotations in red highlight the updated zip file and the received expected answer. This suggests a test where the user modified the `abcd.zip` file to test a different data scenario and validated the expected response from the API.


In summary, the image depicts a successful API test where a user uploaded a modified zip file containing a CSV with a different data value, and the API responded with the expected result extracted from this CSV file.  The test is clearly designed to verify the API's ability to correctly process and extract information from updated files.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/d/b/db93b66e0ad980008bf6fcb646ee499e77ca12b9_2_690x330.png)

**Image Description:** This image shows a screenshot of an API request being made using a tool like Postman.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **API Endpoint:** The top line shows the API endpoint being targeted: `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`.  The request method is POST.

* **Request Body:** The "Body" section is crucial.¬†It's set to `form-data`.  Two key-value pairs are defined:
    * `question`:  A text field containing the question: "What is the value in the "answer" column of the..."
    * `file`: A file upload field, containing a file named `def.zip`.  The description next to the file upload indicates that this zip file contains a CSV with column names but no actual data.

* **Response:** The "Test Results" section displays the API response.  It's a JSON object with a single key-value pair: `"error": "Answer column not found or empty."` This confirms the expected result‚Äîan error message because the uploaded CSV lacked data in the "answer" column.

* **Annotations:** Red annotations on the image highlight these key aspects: the uploaded `def.zip` file (described as a CSV with only column names), and the error message received as the API response.  These annotations emphasize the intended test scenario and its successful outcome.

In short, the image documents a test of an API endpoint designed to process CSV files. The test successfully verifies that the API correctly handles and reports an error when a CSV is missing the expected data in a specific column ("answer").

**Image Description:** The image contains a JSON-formatted error response.  Let's break down the key components:

* **`api`**: This field gives the API endpoint URL: `"https://roe-i6ghzat4g-manu-cs-projects.vercel.app/api/"`. This indicates the location of the API that returned the error.

* **`test_code`**: This field has the value `"GA1_q18"`, likely a test identifier or code.

* **`status`**: This field shows the status of the request: `"ERROR"`.  Clearly, something went wrong.

* **`error`**: This is the most crucial part, describing the nature of the error. It contains the message: `"near \"```sql\nSELECT SUM(price* units) AS total_sales\nFROM tickets\nWHERE LOWER (type) = 'gold';\n```\": syntax error"`.  This points to a SQL syntax error in a query submitted to the API.


**The SQL Error:**

The error message shows the problematic SQL query:

```sql
SELECT SUM(price * units) AS total_sales
FROM tickets
WHERE LOWER(type) = 'gold';
```

The error says the syntax error is "near" this query which implies the actual error lies within the query itself.  This query appears to intend to calculate the total sales of 'gold' type tickets. However, there could be minor syntax problems (missing parenthesis or a typo) within it that needs to be fixed.  The API likely attempted to execute this query against a database and received the syntax error from the database management system (DBMS).

In summary, the image displays a JSON response indicating a failed API call due to a syntax error in a SQL query intended to retrieve total sales figures for 'gold' tickets from a 'tickets' table.

Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Headline:** "Get In Touch" is prominently displayed at the top.

* **Invitation:** The text "Feel free to reach out for collaborations or just a friendly chat!" encourages contact.

* **Email Address:** A full email address is provided: 24f2006438@ds.study.iitm.ac.in.  This suggests a connection to an educational institution (possibly the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, judging by "iitm.ac.in").  The "24f2006438" part likely represents a student ID or similar identifier.

* **Search Filters:** Below the search bar are filter options: "Search", a dropdown menu for "Stories", "by", a dropdown for "Popularity", "for", and a dropdown for selecting a time range ("All time").

* **Search Results:** The main body displays two entries, both labeled as "Ad:" followed by the title "An Adaptable Text Editor".  Both entries link to the same GitHub repository, `https://github.com/sminez/ad`, highlighted in yellow.¬† Each entry provides the number of points it received, the submitter's username, the time since submission (in months and "ago"), and the number of comments it received.


In essence, the image shows two separate instances of the same advertisement for a text editor on Hacker News, from different times and with differing levels of popularity. The search bar shows the URL directly was likely typed in for these search results.

Case 3: JSON Key Count ‚Äì XF Parameter (GA5_q7)


{


‚Äúapi‚Äù: ‚Äú
https://app.algsoch.tech/api/
‚Äù,


‚Äútest_code‚Äù: ‚ÄúGA5_q7‚Äù,


‚Äústatus‚Äù: ‚ÄúERROR‚Äù,


‚Äúerror‚Äù: ‚Äúinvalid literal for int() with base 10: ‚ÄòError: Invalid JSON in the file. Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)‚Äô‚Äù


}


 What Was Expected:


The question required developing a script that:






Parses a large, deeply nested JSON log file, and






Counts how many times a specific key ‚Äî represented by XF ‚Äî appears in the JSON structure.






It was explicitly stated that:






Only key matches for XF are to be counted, not values.






The file to be used was:

E:\data science tool\GA5\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json






 What I Did:


I used the correct approach, parsing the nested JSON file and counting how many times the key XF appeared throughout the structure.


Here‚Äôs the actual response I got using this cURL command:


curl -X POST 
https://app.algsoch.tech/api/
 \


-H ‚Äúaccept: application/json‚Äù \


-F ‚Äúquestion=‚Ä¶How many times does XF appear as a key?‚Äù \


-F ‚Äúfile=@E:\data science tool\GA5\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json‚Äù


API Output:{‚Äúanswer‚Äù:‚Äú14602‚Äù}


This indicates that my logic worked correctly and the key XF appeared 14,602 times, exactly as intended.


 What Went Wrong on API Side:


The API returned a parsing error, indicating:


‚Äúinvalid literal for int() with base 10: ‚ÄòError: Invalid JSON in the file‚Ä¶‚Äô‚Äù


However:






My file was valid JSON, properly parsed.






The actual issue seems to be on the API‚Äôs side ‚Äî possibly mishandling the file read or decoding before passing it to the evaluator.






It may have expected an integer but received a string-wrapped error or non-integer data, causing it to crash.






 Insight:


If the original question was about counting the key XF, my solution was 100% correct.


However, if the question dynamically changed the key name or added extra criteria (e.g., only count if value == true, or only under a certain section), then the result might differ. But from the default XF-focused question, my logic and result match perfectly.

**Image Description:** The image contains a JSON object representing an API response.  The key features are:

* **`api`**: This field provides the API endpoint URL: `"https://roe-i6ghzat4g-manu-cs-projects.vercel.app/api/"`.  This indicates the location of the API server.

* **`test_code`**: This field contains the string `"GA1_q18"`, possibly a test code or identifier for the request.

* **`status`**: This field indicates the status of the API request, reporting `"ERROR"`.  This signifies that the request encountered a problem.

* **`error`**: This field details the nature of the error, which is a "syntax error" within a SQL query.  The SQL query itself is embedded within the error message, revealing an attempt to calculate the sum of `price * units` as `total_sales` from a `tickets` table where the lowercase version of a `type` column equals 'gold'.  The SQL appears to have a syntax issue (likely related to the way the string literal is formatted), causing the error. The backticks surrounding `sql` suggest an attempt to embed the query into another system (possibly a programming language).

In short, the image shows an error response from an API call that tried to execute a malformed SQL query.  The error message reveals both the faulty SQL and the location of the API endpoint.

Good Afternoon Sir.

This is regarding project 1 and project 2.


Project-1 Evaluation

Sir, For the project 1, I have written the code, uploaded in GitHub and the dockerfile image is created and uploaded successfully.

Sir, I already contacted regarding Project - 1, you said to check it by replicating the test environment. I did till running the dockerfile but I needed evaluate.py sir, which I didn‚Äôt get it. I got only 5 marks sir. Can you please check my code once sir and verify it as I have written the code and the dockerfile is running successfully.


Project-2 Evaluation

Regarding project 2 also, I have uploaded my code in GitHub and deployed my app in Vercel. But, I got 0 sir. Can you check my code once again and verify it? According to the guidance given, I deployed my app through Vercel. The app got deployed but I am getting 404 Error, even after trying any troubleshooting method. Maybe, Vercel is in development stage.


Sir, but I wrote the code and deployed, but I got 0 marks only. Please check it and guide me to get it corrected. Sir, due to the projects I got poor marks on TDS. Please, I request you to re-evaluate and give me correct marks.


In anticipation of quick response

Thank You

Hi everyone,


I know that some of you might be feeling anxious about your scores etc. We are currently in the process of validating your scores on all the projects, roe, assignments, exam and bonus, so we will not be able to respond quickly to each individual post here for the time being.


Once we validate, you will receive an email with your official scores that we will be pushing to Operations in a single update. Along with that email you will receive a discrepancy form where you can raise your issues. This will give us a consolidated view of problems and fix them.


Kindly wait for the email to come to you. It will be sent sometime this afternoon.

Why am my I getting 
GET
 request to my api endpoint? It must be IITM‚Äôs http request because I have not shared it with anyone.

804√ó1035 206 KB


It clearly written in the project 2 in TDS portal that api  must  accept  
POST
 request, not 
GET
.

It is requested to kindly look into this matter and please clarify.

**Image Description:** The image shows a log file, likely from a web server, displaying a series of HTTP requests and responses.  The majority of the requests are `GET` requests for the root directory (`/`) or the favicon (`/favicon.ico`).  A significant number of these requests result in a "404 Not Found" response, indicating that the requested resource does not exist on the server.  There are also a few "PRI *2A HTTP/2.0" requests, which are HTTP/2 preamble requests.  Furthermore, there are several instances of "Invalid HTTP request received" warnings interspersed throughout the log, suggesting issues with the format or structure of some incoming requests.

The log entries include the following information for each request:

* **INFO/WARNING:** Indicates the severity level of the entry.  "INFO" is for informational messages, while "WARNING" indicates a problem.
* **IP Address and Port:** The source IP address and port number of the client making the request.
* **HTTP Method:**  Primarily "GET," indicating a request to retrieve a resource.  There are a few "PRI" requests.
* **Request Path:** The path requested by the client, most commonly "/" or "/favicon.ico".
* **HTTP Version:** Mostly "HTTP/1.1," but there are a few "HTTP/1.0" and "HTTP/2.0" examples.
* **HTTP Status Code:** Almost all entries show "404 Not Found."

The sheer volume of 404 errors and invalid request warnings points to a potential issue with either client-side requests (malformed requests from clients) or server-side configuration (missing files or incorrect routing).  The presence of multiple requests for `/favicon.ico` is quite common and doesn't necessarily indicate a problem on its own.  However, the repeated 404s for the root path (`/`) strongly suggests a misconfiguration or missing default webpage.

**Image Description:** The image contains a code example demonstrating how to make a POST request to an API endpoint using the `curl` command.  The text preceding the code explains the scenario:

* **API Endpoint:** The application has an API endpoint located at `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/`.  This is a placeholder;  "your-app" would be replaced with the actual application name.

* **Request Type:** The endpoint accepts POST requests.

* **Data Types:** The POST request can include both textual data (the "question") and optional file attachments using the `multipart/form-data` content type.

* **Code Example (Bash):** The `curl` command shows how to send a POST request with the following:
    * `-X POST`: Specifies a POST request.
    * `"https://your-app.vercel.app/api/"`: The target API endpoint URL.
    * `-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"`: Sets the content type for multipart data.
    * `-F "question=Download and unzip file abcd.zip which has a single extract.csv file inside. What is t`:  Sends the question as part of the request.  The question is truncated in the image.
    * `-F "file=@abcd.zip"`: Sends a file named `abcd.zip` as an attachment.


In essence, the image describes how to interact with an API, specifically showing a way to upload a zip file and send a question in a single request. The example uses a placeholder file name (`abcd.zip`) and question, which would be replaced with actual values in a real-world scenario. The `bash` label indicates the code snippet is intended for a bash shell environment.

## Post #700 by kartikay1 (Post ID: 621440)
I had completed project 2 but because of a mistake i filled the form with my personal mail id fue to which the project eas not evaluated i fully consider this to be my fault and assure that something like this will not happen in the future .


If my evaluation of project 2 is not done then i will fail the tds course and will have to repeat this course which will cause a financial strain on me


I know that it is difficult for you to consider this request but it is my humblest request if you can just look through the project i tried to complete the project with the best of my abilities


It will be really helpful if you can access the project

My git repository link is - GitHub - kartikayy1/project2final


My vercel link is - 
https://project2final-beta.vercel.app/

## Post #701 by 23f2005138 (Post ID: 621446)
I am also receiving the odd GET requests, however, I don‚Äôt believe these are being sent by the evaluation teams. Our endpoints are open to internet and there are bots everywhere which will send these kind of random requests to scan for potential exploit/hacking targets.

Just recieved this on my mail. Happy that everything worked out pretty well w/o the need for hardcoding. I‚Äôm guessing GA1-q18 bugged out because of escape sequences in the codeblock 
 That‚Äôs LLMs for you!

**Image Description:** The image shows a dark-themed code editor or viewer displaying the contents of a JSON file named "22f3001642.json".  The JSON file contains an array of objects, each representing a test case.

Key features and details:

* **Filename:**  The filename "22f3001642.json" is prominently displayed at the top. This suggests the file's purpose and location.

* **JSON Structure:** The content is valid JSON, showing an array (`[]`) of objects (`{}`). Each object has two key-value pairs:

    * `"test_code"`: A string identifying the specific test (e.g., "GA1_q18").  The pattern suggests a grouping (GA) and a question number (q18, q3, etc.).

    * `"status"`: A string indicating the test result, either "ERROR" or "PASSED".

* **Error Details:** One object has an `"error"` key containing a detailed error message. This message includes a SQL query that caused the error:

```sql
SELECT
SUM(units * price) AS total_sales
FROM
tickets
WHERE LOWER(type) = 'gold';
```

The error message states a "syntax error" near the SQL query, implying a problem with the SQL code itself.  The backticks surrounding the query are likely intended to represent the query within the error message, but could also be part of the syntax error.


In summary, the image displays the results of a series of tests, one of which failed due to a SQL syntax error. The detailed error message and SQL query provide crucial debugging information.

**Image Description:** The image shows a GitHub page displaying the code of a Python file named `Q23.py` within the `GASolver` repository.  The top shows the GitHub URL: `https://github.com/TDS-Hackers/GASolver/blob/main/GA2/Q23.py`.  The repository is named `GASolver`, and the file is part of a directory named `GA2`.

The main content is a Python function `execute` that takes a question (string) and a parameter as input.  The function appears to retrieve information based on an email address contained within the parameter.  Lines 7-12 define a dictionary called `cache` which maps email addresses (e.g., `23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`) to GitHub repository URLs. If the email address is found in `cache`, the corresponding URL is returned. Otherwise, the function returns a message prompting the user to enter the URL.  The code uses the `os` and `json` libraries.  There is a comment indicating that the function may have originally used `gitPortfolio` function, but now uses the `cache` instead.

The left sidebar lists other `.py` files in the `GA2` directory.  The top-right shows version information (`Version 1`) and a commit hash (`23f2004837`).  The number of lines (132), logical lines of code (105 loc), and file size (4.37 KB) are also displayed.  Standard GitHub interface elements such as "Issues," "Pull requests," etc., are visible at the top.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/5/1/51eb6aa84b57bc9d3cfc1e19f341e86c85452318_2_690x305.png)

**Image Description:** The image is a screenshot of a webpage.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Address Bar:** A standard web browser address bar shows a padlock icon (indicating a secure connection), a back arrow, a refresh icon, and the URL `https://23f2004837.github.io`.

* **Large Text:** The most prominent element is the email address `23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` displayed in bold, black font.

* **Smaller Text (Repeated):** The same email address (`23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`) is repeated twice below the large text, once in plain text and once as a hyperlink in blue.

The image strongly suggests that the email address is the main focus and possibly the purpose of the webpage.  The GitHub URL in the address bar might indicate a related online presence or profile.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/4/2/42a64456808f873555ff4de31837f03230d11cc7_2_690x236.png)

**Image Description:** The image shows a screenshot of a web browser's developer tools, specifically the "Elements" tab.  The displayed content is HTML source code.

The code shows a simple HTML structure:

*   An `<h1>` tag containing the email address "23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in".
*   A `<p>` tag containing a seemingly-unrelated "==$0" (possibly from debugging).
*   An `<a>` tag which creates a clickable mailto link for the same email address ("23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in").


The browser's tab bar at the top shows the typical elements of a browser's developer tools: "Welcome", "Elements", "Console", "Sources", "Network", and a partially visible "Performance" tab.  This indicates the screenshot was taken from a web browser's debugging environment.

In short, the image displays a very simple piece of HTML code that creates a webpage with a heading and a clickable email address. The "==$0" within the `<p>` tag suggests this code might be part of a larger debugging or development process.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/7/7/77d9640fb9b880c88e9a584b9ede792c689fbe11_2_690x240.png)

**Image Description:** Here's a description of the image content:

The image shows a browser developer tools window.  The top section contains a prompt asking for a GitHub Pages URL. A URL, `https://23f2004837.github.io/`, is entered, and the status indicates "Checking...".  Instructions below explain how to add version parameters (?v=1, ?v=2) to the URL to clear the cache if needed.

The lower portion displays the "Sources" tab of the developer tools.  The left panel shows a file list, including JavaScript files like `exam.js` and files with names suggesting a project related to "tds-2025-01-ga2".  The main section shows the code of `exam.js`.  This code appears to contain a JavaScript function that makes a fetch request to the GitHub Pages URL entered earlier (`https://23f2004837.github.io/`), likely for checking if a resource exists or is correctly updated.  The code includes error handling (`catch`) and a conditional statement (`else`). A highlighted line suggests a return statement that might send back some weighting or value based on the result of the fetch.  The other tabs in the developer tools ("Network," "Performance," "Memory," "Application") are also visible.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/4/7/4785d546f9503ff0afe19412b56481c7aa53398b_2_690x122.png)

**Image Description:** The image contains a multiple-choice question and answer related to GitHub Pages URLs.

The question asks, "What is the GitHub Pages URL? It might look like: `https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/`"  The example URL uses bracketed placeholders `[USER]` and `[REPO]` to represent the username and repository name, respectively.

Below the question is a text input box containing the answer: `https://23f2004837.github.io/`.  This URL follows the structure shown in the question, with "23f2004837" acting as the user name.  There is no repository name specified in this particular example.

Finally, the word "Correct" is displayed beneath the answer box, indicating that the provided URL is a valid GitHub Pages URL.

I would like to bring to your attention that the project URL I submitted was accessible and working correctly in my browser, even without the ‚Äúhttp‚Äù or ‚Äúhttps‚Äù prefix. A friend of mine submitted a similar URL and received full marks. Furthermore, I have updated my URL using HTTPS via Google Forms, so I kindly request you to consider evaluating my project using the latest URL provided.


This is a humble request, as I am currently at risk of receiving a grade ‚ÄòE‚Äô, which will significantly impact my overall CGPA. As an alternative, I am also willing to retake the course in the next term and pay the fee again if needed.


In the P1, unfortunately scored zero due to a minor mistake and was not given an opportunity to correct it. I truly believe that in real-life scenarios, we are often given chances to rectify such errors, and I sincerely hope for the same consideration here.

Subject:
 Request to Share My Student-Built TDS Assistant Platform


Dear Sir/Madam,


I hope you‚Äôre doing well.


I‚Äôm 
Vicky Kumar
, a student from the Data Science and Applications program at 
IIT Madras
. Over the last few months, I‚Äôve built a personal project called 
‚ÄúVicky App‚Äù
 ‚Äî a smart assistant platform specifically designed to help students in courses like 
TDS,
.


The system is capable of:




Accurately solving over 
90% of assignment-style questions
 using regex and phonetic matching


Dynamically executing the right code logic based on the student‚Äôs input


Processing uploaded files such as Excel, PDF, CSV, and JSON


Delivering instant answers, completely independent of ChatGPT or any external LLM




You can test the platform here: 
https://app.algsoch.tech




 What‚Äôs in it for students:




They type their question, and the backend executes the correct solution automatically


Especially helpful for GA preparation, understanding problem logic, and reducing repetitive workload


I‚Äôve made it 
free for the first 3 questions


After that, students can access the full platform for just 
‚Çπ199/month
, which helps me cover system maintenance and hosting costs






 My Humble Request:


This is a tool I‚Äôve built with immense effort and love for this course, and I genuinely believe it can benefit many students.


To sustain the platform ‚Äî hosting, APIs, file management, and backend orchestration ‚Äî I‚Äôve introduced a small paid model after a free trial.


I would be extremely grateful if you could test it once and, if you find it helpful, consider sharing it with upcoming students or mentioning it in a Moodle announcement.


It‚Äôs built 
by an IIT Madras student, for IIT Madras students
 ‚Äî with the sole goal of making their learning smoother, faster, and smarter.


Thank you so much for your time and support.


Warm regards,


Vicky Kumar
