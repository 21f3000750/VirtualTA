*   **Background:** Introductory text that explains the context of the question. It mentions the "Haversine formula" and its application in distance calculations.
*   **Student-ChatGPT Discussion Thread:** The question is presented as a conversation between a student and ChatGPT.
*   **Location Data:** The student presents two locations (A and B) with their latitude and longitude coordinates.
    *   Location A: Latitude = 40.748817, Longitude = -73.985428
    *   Location B: Latitude = 40.761293, Longitude = -73.982294
*   **Student's Question:** The student asks for help in calculating the distance between the two locations using the Haversine formula.

**Overall Impression:**

The screenshot captures a student working on a "TDS" (likely a course subject) end-term quiz. The quiz question involves using the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between two geographical locations, mirroring a real-world application of the formula. The question is framed as a discussion between a student and ChatGPT, suggesting the student is seeking assistance or guidance. is not a valid file path.]
