The lectures primarily focus on surface-level explanations without ensuring a strong foundational understanding of the topics. Key concepts, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies, are not explained in a structured manner, making it difficult for students to follow.

Hi Hari,


The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.


Have you watched this session in particular?










If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it










followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases










But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.


Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.


Kind regards

**Image Description:** The image is a graphic designed to look like a digital presentation slide.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

*   **Background:** The background consists of a warm, reddish-orange rectangle. On top of this, there's a darker blue rectangle that frames the central text and images.
*   **Text:** The prominent text within the frame reads "WEEK 3" and "SESSION 1" in large, white, bold letters. The text is centered.
*   **Icons and Graphics:** There is a collection of stylized icons. These icons appear to relate to information technology or data analysis. They are arranged around the text, particularly at the top and bottom, but some are in the middle as well. They depict:

    *   Circle graphs
    *   Pencils
    *   Computer-like schematics
    *   Network connections
    *   Bar graphs
    *   A globe
    *   Other geometric shapes.

*   **Color Palette:** The image features a muted, yet modern, color scheme of warm oranges, blues, reds, yellows, and shades of gray.
*   **Overall Impression:** The image presents itself as a title slide for a presentation, possibly about data science or technology-related training. The combination of graphics and text is intended to make the presentation look engaging.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Scene:**

The image shows a computer screen displaying a browser window, likely Google Chrome. The background of the browser window is a stylized illustration of a character from the anime Naruto. On the right side of the screen, there's a video call or meeting interface with a user's name displayed.

**Browser Window:**

*   **Tabs:** The browser has several tabs open. One tab is open to a Google Meet session. The browser search bar shows the search term "Large language models".
*   **Speed Dial/Bookmarks:** Below the search bar, there are multiple rectangular tiles, likely representing bookmarks or speed dial entries. These include:
    *   "amit..." (the rest of the website address is cut off)
    *   "DS Discourse"
    *   "App Dev II Project Doc..."
    *   "(159) Tools in Data Scie..."
    *   "Java Tutorial | Learn Jav..."
    *   "Prime Number Progra..."
    *   "POSA"
    *   "tds june 2024"
    *   "MAD-2 resources"
*   **Background:** The browser background is an illustration of Naruto.

**Video Call/Meeting Interface (Right side):**

*   **Avatar:** A round, white avatar with a stylized design.
*   **Name:** Below the avatar is the name "Amit Kumar Gupta".

**Additional details:**

*   **Operating System:** The "Type here to search" and the Start Menu in the bottom left corner indicates that the operating system is Windows.
*   **Date and Time:** The date and time "20:14 11-07-2024" are displayed in the bottom right corner of the screen.
*   **Windows Activation:** The message "Activate Windows" is displayed on the bottom of the browser, suggesting that Windows hasn't been activated yet.

**Possible Context:**

Based on the elements, this image likely captures a user in a video call (using Google Meet). The user is also browsing the internet, possibly for information related to their work or studies. The presence of bookmarks and the nature of the items suggest the user is involved in programming, data science, or a related field.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Scene:**

*   The image shows a screen recording or a screenshot of a laptop screen, likely during a presentation or online lecture. There is also a video call screen in the corner.

**Main Elements:**

*   **Web Browser:**  A web browser (Chrome) is open, displaying a webpage that appears to be part of an online course platform.
    *   **URL:** The URL visible in the address bar is: `https://seek.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/courses/ns_24t2_se2002?id=160&type=lesson&tab=courses&unitid=158`. This indicates a course related to "TDS" (likely "Time Series Data").
    *   **Course Content:** The webpage focuses on "Data sourcing."
    *   **Content Description:**  The page includes a description of data sourcing and outlines control extraction area, saving extracted data, and related resources. A section labeled "Optional: Real-life scraping" is highlighted.
    *   **Links:** There are links to relevant resources like "PDF Scraping - Notebook,"  "tabula package," and "pandas package".
    *   **Main Content area:** A section describes the real life scraping with emarketer.com as a demo.
*   **Course Menu:** On the left, there's a course menu with sections like "Course introduction," "Self assessment," "Data discovery," "Data Sourcing," and more.
*   **Video Call:** In the upper right corner, there's a small video window of the video conference, featuring a person (Carlton D'Silva) with a circular image.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Time & Date:** The upper right corner shows the date and time: "Fri 12 Jul 20:22".
*   **Tabs:** Multiple tabs are open in the browser.
*   **Screen Layout:** The left side of the screen is dedicated to the course menu. The main content of the webpage is displayed in the center, and the video call is in the upper right.

**Possible Context:**

Based on the content, this appears to be a screen recording of a lesson related to data science or data analysis. The lecture likely focuses on techniques to extract and work with data. The "Real-life scraping" section suggests the lesson also covered web scraping.
