Update 3


26/02/2025 8:11 pm


Dear Learner


Please access the Mock ROE 2 at this link:








exam.sanand.workers.dev






Technical Assessment












There is no time limit for this Mock. The expected time to solve this ROE is 45 mins. Set an alarm and try it.

After the session at 9pm there will be a session where we will show you the solutions step by step (not like the previous session which was a demo of ROE).

To check your answers you will need to run the following script in the console.


inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')
textboxes = document.querySelectorAll("textarea")
buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button")
inputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
buttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
textboxes.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));



Do not submit or save your answers.


All the best!

Kind regards

TDS Team


Update 2


26/02/2025 11:00 am


We will be releasing Mock 2 tonight on an exam portal at 8pm (no time limit).

The link for the Mock 2 will be available in this post as well as in the Seek Portal. An email will also be sent with the link to Mock 2.


We will be conducting a solving session at 9pm. This will be a regular teaching session (not like the first session on Tuesday 25/02/25 which was a real preview of what ROE looks like).


Kind regards,

TDS Team




Update 1


25/02/2025 7:46pm


We have now closed the mock submissions.

Both the dataset and the form submissions will reopen after tonights live session.




Announcement


25/02/2025


This same information is available in the seek portal as well.


The data for Mock ROE 1 is available at this link:


Jivraj-18/tds-jan-2025-mock-roe-1


The questions for Mock ROE 1 is available at this link:


https://forms.gle/UWhvLQvjrJmnvMSn6


IMPORTANT: We will accept only a single submission of the Mock Question Form. Solve all the questions first, and then fill the form and make a single submission at the end.


The form submission will be temporarily closed after 8pm.


We have provided this for you to test yourself. The expected time to complete this Mock ROE is 45 mins.


We will allow access to the Mock ROE and the question form after the live solving session tonight.


All the best!

dear 
@carlton

when will yesterday’s recorded session on mock ROE 1 be uploaded on YouTube?

---

## Post #15 by carlton (Post ID: 599854)
@23f2003413


We will have it uploaded sometime this morning.


It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:




The chaos of ROE.


The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.


The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).


The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.


The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly


Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions


The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).


How limited the time is.




The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.

Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.


Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).


I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.


Kind regards

## Post #19 by shubhamatkal (Post ID: 600114)
Hello 
@carlton
 sir , for me given constituency was 
"SRI GOBINDPUR"

and in the dataset there are multiple names for this constituency i think over the period names were changed of this constituency

i have filtered constituencies from punjab using below code in colab


df_gobindpur = df[df["AC"].str.contains("SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR", case=False, na=False)]



is this correct approach or i have to consider only SRI GOBINDPUR name only? but then this constituency is not availble after 1957


using above filtering i got below data for SRI GOBINDPUR




drive.google.com








df_gobindpur.csv


Google Drive file.












then i used margin formula as


margin_percentage = ((winner_votes - runner_up_votes) / total_votes) * 100



using this i got answer for 1st question as


YEAR                              1992
AC                   4 SRIHARGOBINDPUR
WINNER                  1 GURNAM SINGH
WINNER_PARTY                       CPI
WINNER_VOTES                    5000.0
RUNNER_UP               2 MUSTAK MASIH
RUNNER_UP_PARTY                    INC
RUNNER_UP_VOTES                 1115.0
MARGIN_PERCENTAGE            50.599114



which is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64

pls guide where i might be wrong, thanks

shubhamatkal:




df_gobindpur = df[df["AC"].str.contains("SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR", case=False, na=False)]







For this kind of name difference you can use Openrefine software








 shubhamatkal:




which is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64






That answer is wrong, we will be releasing a script with correct python snippets.

Kind regards.

@Jivraj
 
@carlton

“SATHUPALLE” and “NILANGA” were two of the four constituencies which were assigned to me. However, even with phonetic match, I couldn’t find any data for these.  Closest I could find to SATHUPALLE is “Sattenapalle”, however, two are different locations 150km+ apart as per google maps. Are these really in the dataset?

## Post #22 by Jivraj (Post ID: 600326)
Hi 
@23f2005138
,


We didn’t validate locations on Nominathim, so there might be some problems.

Q1: Download and unzip q-count-gold-ticket-sales-from-html.zip. It has a set of HTML files, each with tables of 3 columns: Type, Units, and Price.


What is the total sales of all the items in the “Gold” ticket type? Round to 2 decimal places (e.g. 123.40).


!unzip /content/q-count-gold-ticket-sales-from-html.zip -d /content/extracted_folder



import os
import pandas as pd
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup




total_sales = 0
html_folder = "/content/extracted_folder"  # Update if the folder name is different

for file in os.listdir(html_folder):
    if file.endswith(".html"):
        file_path = os.path.join(html_folder, file)

        # Step 3: Read the HTML content and extract tables
        with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            soup = BeautifulSoup(f, "html.parser")
        
        tables = pd.read_html(str(soup))  # Extract all tables

        for table in tables:
            if {"Type", "Units", "Price"}.issubset(table.columns):
                # Step 4: Filter "Gold" ticket type and calculate total sales
                table["Type"] = table["Type"].str.strip().str.lower()
                gold_sales = table[table["Type"] == "gold"]["Units"] * table[table["Type"] == "gold"]["Price"]
                total_sales += gold_sales.sum()
# Step 5: Print the result rounded to 2 decimal places
print(f"Total Gold Ticket Sales: {total_sales:.2f}")

Just to confirm, we are allowed to collaborate our code with our peers?

Sir, Can we get these live sessions recorded on YouTube

## Post #43 by carlton (Post ID: 600432)
We are expecting you to collaborate. But you got to do it in a methodical organised way. Like NASA trying to get the 3 men in Apollo 13 back home. 

Work together like a team. One man band is tough or impossible. So is a hodgepodge of directionless people. So a proper team can perhaps crack it.


Kind regards

## Post #44 by trebhuvansb (Post ID: 600435)
But there is seems to be a very thin line between collaborating and people just taking other people’s code and using them to generate their answer instead of also participating in the collaboration. So I was confused about the “collaborating” thing.

I understand that sentiment. I struggle with it a lot too when discussing it with Anand. Is there value or learning, in blind copying. Im not so sure. At some point someone has to learn to become an expert. A critical thinker. There is even a Microsoft study now that shows that GPT usage impacts critical thinking. Are we going to end up with a generation of people who can no longer critically think to solve a problem? These are good philosophical questions. I lie somewhere more on the conservative side of that spectrum. But everyone has to grapple with this tradeoff. Where does the right balance lie? I don’t know the answer to that question for others. I know the right answer for me.


Kind regards

Thanks, today’s mock was manageable unlike yesterday’s one. I got some correct within 45 minutes, but yesterday, I couldn’t even complete scraping.

---

## Post #47 by trebhuvansb (Post ID: 600453)
I feel less complex (but still questions that test your critical thinking) and proctored ROE (with access to documentation of the different services used) could help. In this way people can use gpt models to crack the difficult GA questions but through ROE you can actually still test their knowledge on the topics which are covered.


But this too has its caveats, there doesn’t seem to be a proper solution to this

There was no need to scrape Sagan, you could have copied the whole table and pasted it into an excel sheet and exported it as a csv file. Try it out once!

Many of us have no idea about how to solve these questions within the given timeframe, so it is highly appreciable that the team uploads these recorded live sessions in YT at the earliest. Thanks!

How many questions will we be having in our ROE?

Because I remember Anand sir mentioning 17 questions in the explanation of the difficulty of the ROE

---

## Post #62 by carlton (Post ID: 600905)
It completely depends on the ROE. There is just no reasonable way of knowing how many questions ROE will have. If there is only 1 question, I would be very worried.

## Post #64 by trebhuvansb (Post ID: 601024)
I thought the mocks would be a representation of the actual ROE and the mocks had 6 questions so I assumed 6 questions.

---

## Post #65 by Saransh_Saini (Post ID: 601038)
Mocks are just to give you a feel of what an ROE is about, and to get you comfortable with the 45 min time limit. So, the number of questions in the real ROE is going to have little correlation with the question count in the mocks.

Respected

@carlton


Based on the ROE mock assessments, I kindly request you to consider extending the allotted time for the ROE. Some tasks require downloading libraries, whereas you may already have these libraries or other necessary setups in place, which naturally reduces your solving time.


As you are aware, additional time will only benefit those who have prepared and possess the required knowledge. Students without preparation will not gain any advantage simply due to an extension. Furthermore, as the course has been modified from the previous term and many aspects are still being refined, we have already requested measures to support our performance and ensure our grades are not put at undue risk.


I genuinely prioritize knowledge over marks and have put in significant effort to excel in this course. However, I do not want to risk failing. My goal is simply to meet  the passing criteria (at least 40 marks) . Therefore, I sincerely request you to consider granting additional time for the ROE as a reasonable relief.


Your understanding and support in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Best Regards,

Lakshay

## Post #70 by 22f3000819 (Post ID: 601095)
Yeah especially if the system is slow, it takes too much time to download libraries. Colab provides more RAM but it frequently stops runtime and restarting it again is very time-consuming.

**Image Description:** [Image analysis : The image depicts a challenge presented on a screen, likely part of a cybersecurity exercise. The text at the top introduces SecurePrompt Technologies, a cybersecurity firm specializing in deploying large language models (LLMs) for sensitive enterprise applications. They impose hardcoded behavioral instructions on the LLMs to ensure adherence to security policies. The image explains that SecurePrompt conducts security audits and red-team exercises to test how well the LLMs follow these instructions and to determine if it is possible to bypass or trick the LLM into violating its security constraints.

The task presented to the user is to chat with an LLM that has been told to never say "Yes." The objective is to write a prompt that will get the LLM to say "Yes." The user is instructed to use their AI Proxy token when prompted. There is a text input box for the user to write the prompt.

At the bottom of the image, there's a message indicating that as long as the LLM says the word "Yes" (case sensitive), the user will be marked correct. It also warns the user to be careful and not change the answer if it is correct, as they might get a different answer the next time. is not a valid file path.]

The json from the webpage does not match the data in the mock roe webpage. Its a little trick that Anand implemented so that its not so easy to do. It was basically to see if you could spot the difference. These things do happen in the real world where the backend sends something and someone has done some जुगाड़ code on the front end just to get the job done for the client. So when you are trying to scrape the data for some analysis things dont quite seem what they are.
