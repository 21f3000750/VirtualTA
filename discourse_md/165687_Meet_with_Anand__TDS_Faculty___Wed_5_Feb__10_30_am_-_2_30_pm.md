I will be at the IIT Madras campus next Wednesday (5 Feb) from 10:30 am to 2:30 pm IST.


I’ll be at the NAC (New Academic Complex) or the NAC footsteps.


If anyone would like to chat - about TDS, or anything else - you’re welcome.

### Image Insight:

**Image Description:** The image contains a short biographical profile of someone named Anand S.  The text is formatted as a short online biography or profile page.

Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Heading:** "Anand S." is prominently displayed at the top, followed by "CEO, Gramener". This identifies Anand S. as the CEO of a company called Gramener.

* **Profile Section:**  A section labeled "Profile" introduces Anand's professional achievements:
    * **Professional Roles:** He's a co-founder of Gramener, a data science company, and leads a team focused on visual data storytelling.  He's also recognized as one of India's top 10 scientists and a regular TEDx speaker.
    * **Education & Work Experience:** He's a gold medalist from IIM Bangalore and an alumnus of IIT Madras, London Business School, IBM, Infosys Consulting, Lehman Brothers, and BCG.  These credentials highlight his academic and professional background in business and technology.

* **Personal Interests:** The profile includes less formal details demonstrating his personality:
    * **Hobbies:**  He has hand-transcribed every Calvin & Hobbes comic strip, is addicted to Minecraft, and aims to watch every film on the IMDb Top 250 list (excluding "The Shining"). These show his personal interests outside of his professional life.

* **Online Presence:** The profile ends by providing links to his online activities:
    * **Blog:**  s-anand.net
    * **Talks:** bit.ly/anandtalks  These are links to his personal blog and online talks or presentations.


The overall impression is that Anand S. is a successful data scientist and business leader with a strong academic background and diverse personal interests.  The image is likely taken from a website or online profile page.
