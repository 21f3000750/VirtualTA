Connect to the GitHub API-  it lets you fetch user data automatically(go to github developer settings ->personal acceess tokens->tokens(classic)

Search for Users with criteria mentioned in your question

We organize the list from newest to oldest, making it easy to spot the freshest account.

**Image Description:** The image shows a laptop screen displaying a GitHub Actions page.  The top shows the URL `github.com/Sakshi6749/my-repo/actions`.  The main content is a list of workflow runs, three of which are visible:

* **second time:** This workflow run is marked as failed (indicated by a red X). It's labeled "Daily Commit #3," shows a commit hash (`7715436`), indicates it was pushed by user `Sakshi6749`, ran on the `main` branch, and completed 33 minutes ago with 10% completion.

* **Daily Commit:** This run is also marked as failed (red X). It's "Daily Commit #2," manually run by `Sakshi6749`, on the `main` branch, and completed 4 hours ago with 10% completion.

* **Daily Commit:** This is another failed run (red X).  It's labeled "Daily Commit #1," also manually run by `Sakshi6749`, on the `main` branch, completing 4 hours ago with 11s duration.

The left sidebar shows the standard GitHub Actions navigation, including sections for:  `All workflows`, `Daily Commit`, `Management` (with subsections for caches, attestations, runners, usage metrics, and performance metrics).  There's also a search bar at the bottom of the sidebar.  The top bar shows tabs for `Code`, `Issues`, `Pull requests`, `Actions`, `Projects`, `Wiki`, `Security`, `Insights`, and `Settings`.

The bottom of the screen shows the laptop's keyboard and the "ASUS Zenbook" logo.  The time shown in the lower right corner is 23:41, 09-02-2025.  Various browser icons are visible in the taskbar at the bottom.

**Image Description:** The image shows a laptop screen displaying a GitHub repository page for the user "Sakshi6749" and their repository "my-repo". 


Here's a breakdown of the visible information:

* **Repository Information:** The top section shows the repository name ("my-repo"), the owner ("Sakshi6749"), and various tabs (Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights, Settings).  The repository is marked as "Public".

* **Files and Commit History:**  Below this, a file list shows several files and folders, including  `.github/workflows`, `README.md`, and a file simply titled `README`.  Commit messages and timestamps are also displayed, indicating recent activity ("third time" appears multiple times suggesting multiple commits with the same message).  One commit is 31 minutes old, and another is 5 hours old.

* **Repository About Section:** On the right-hand side, the "About" section shows that no description, website, or topics have been provided.  It also displays the number of stars (0), watchers (1), and forks (0).

* **Other Details:**  The bottom of the screen shows the task bar with various applications, and the laptop is identified as an ASUS Zenbook. The user seems to be using a dark theme on the GitHub interface.  There is also a "#Demo" line near the bottom left of the screen suggesting this is a demonstration or test repository.

In summary, the image depicts a GitHub repository with recent commits but lacking a description. The user appears to have been actively working on the repository within the past few hours.
