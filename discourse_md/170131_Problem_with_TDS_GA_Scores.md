In every TDS assignment after the first, I have not seen a submit button in the assignment page so I could not submit it there( I see it in the sanand portal and submit it there)


Now, my assignment score for all assignments (2,3,4,5) shows 0


I am attaching SS of my assignment-5 page to show there was no submit button available there


I had raised this as a ticket in the Support desk(21/Feb) in the past as discourse was not available to me at that time, but this didn’t get resolved. I saw a similar older thread where it was mentioned that this is not something to worry about but now it is showing in the portal that I am not allowed to take the End Term Exam. What can be done for this?

### Image Insight:

**Image Description:** The image shows a computer screen displaying an online learning platform.  The main content is information about a "Graded Assignment 5".

**Key details:**

* **Course:**  The URL at the top indicates a course from IIT Madras' online degree program.
* **Assignment Details:** The assignment is due 2025-02-21 at 23:59 IST. Multiple submissions are allowed before the deadline, with only the final submission graded.
* **Troubleshooting:**  A section provides instructions for accessing the assignment, including disabling ad blockers, ensuring Javascript and cookies are enabled, using Chrome browser, and disabling browser extensions or overly aggressive antivirus software.  Crucially, students MUST use their student ID to access the assignment.
* **Assignment Link:** The assignment itself is accessible via this link: `https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga5`
* **Course Structure:** A sidebar shows a course outline with modules: "Deployment Tools," "Large Language Models," "Project 1," "Data Sourcing," "Data Preparation," and "Learning Feedback." "Graded Assignment 5" is listed as an assignment.
* **Date:** The top right shows "Jan 2025 - TDS" indicating the month and potentially a course code.


In summary, the image captures a student's view of an online assignment page, detailing the assignment's due date, submission guidelines, troubleshooting tips, and the link to access the assignment. The overall context is an online course from IIT Madras.

 GA5 like all the prior GAs for TDS Jan 25 term were all to be submitted through the graded assignment page. Which is in the link provided (it is actually in the screen shot you have provided).

All the previous GA 1 through 4 were also exactly the same.


We have no evidence you ever submitted any of the other GAs except GA1.


Kind regards
