Is this something to worry about?

### Image Insight:

**Image Description:** The image shows a webpage displaying instructions for a data preparation quiz titled "TDS 2025 Jan GA5 - Data Preparation".  Here's a breakdown of the content:

**Top Section:**

* **Browser Tab:** The browser tab shows the URL `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga5`, indicating an online assessment.  Other tabs are visible, suggesting this is part of a larger online course or learning platform. A "New Chrome available" notification is also present.
* **Quiz Title:**  The main title clearly states "TDS 2025 Jan GA5 - Data Preparation".
* **Quiz Status:** "Ended at Fri, 21 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" shows the quiz completion time.  A score of 0 is initially displayed. "Check all" and "Save" buttons are visible.


**Instructions Section:**

A numbered list of instructions details how to take the quiz:

1.  Students can learn the material provided or skip it.
2.  Answers can be checked repeatedly using the "Check" button.
3.  Saving progress is encouraged using the "Save" button.
4.  Reloading the page is acceptable; answers are saved client-side.
5.  Browser issues can be resolved by disabling security restrictions or changing browsers.
6.  Any resources are permitted (internet, ChatGPT, etc.).
7.  "Hacking" the quiz code to find answers is explicitly allowed.

**Discussion Link:** A button invites users with questions to join a discussion on a platform called "Discourse."

**Login Information:**  The user is logged in as `2313004238@ds.study.litm.ac.in`, indicating a student account at an institution. A "Logout" button is available.

**Recent Saves Section:** A section labelled "Recent saves" displays three saved attempts with timestamps and scores (9, 9, and 8).  This implies that the user has attempted the quiz multiple times and has made several saves.

In short, the image depicts a student completing an online quiz, which allows for multiple attempts, checking answers, and utilizing any available resources, including "hacking" the code.  The quiz's open nature and focus on data preparation are clearly emphasized.

This is nothing to worry about because as you can see in the Recent saves section, it has your score history. We have your entire submission history because we log that.


Kind regards
