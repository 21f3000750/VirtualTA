Can you check the dashboard now, I’ve been informed by operations that the scores have been pushed.


GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual (i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be made to Q4 for students who got Nur-Sultan as their city.


Kind regards

**Overall:**

The image appears to be a screenshot from a Google Meet call. The background is entirely black.

**Key Elements:**

*   **Video Feed:** A circular video feed is centered in the image. It shows a man, likely participating in the Google Meet call.
*   **Man in the Video Feed:** The man has short, dark hair and a beard. He is wearing a yellow t-shirt, on which some text is visible, reading "the same" (the rest of the text is cut off). Behind him is a scenic background with greenery and a bridge.
*   **Google Meet Logo:** In the top right corner, there's the "Google Meet" logo.
*   **Name:** The name "Gokul Vasudevan S" is at the bottom left corner of the screen.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Composition:**

*   The image is a stylized graphic, likely designed for a presentation or educational material. It has a clean, modern aesthetic with bold colors and simple shapes.

**Text:**

*   The main focus of the image is the text "WEEK 5 SESSION 1" in large, white, bold letters. This text appears on a dark blue, slightly translucent rectangular shape, making it stand out clearly.

**Visual Elements (Illustrations and Shapes):**

*   **Top Border:** Along the top edge of the image is a horizontal strip with a series of colorful icons and graphic elements. These seem to be symbolic representations of different concepts, potentially related to technology, data, or education. Some recognizable items include a pencil, a monitor screen, connected dots, and a compass-like shape.
*   **Background:** The background behind the text features a variety of abstract shapes and icons. These may be used to represent concepts like a programming interface, the globe and chart data.
*   **Bottom Border:** The bottom of the image repeats the theme of graphic elements and icons, likely to reiterate the topics presented.

**Color Scheme:**

*   The image uses a color palette of various shades. The background is a light brown/orange, with dark blue as the primary text background, and the shapes within are multi-colored.

**Possible Interpretation:**

*   The image is likely the introductory slide for the first session of week 5 in a course or training program. The icons and illustrations suggest the content might involve technology, data analysis, design, or related fields.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/3/9/3919680685030c27cce9018b86e59128c7487ff6.jpeg)

**Image Description:** The image is a presentation slide or title card, likely for a virtual or in-person session.

Here's a detailed description:

*   **Main Content:** The central focus is a dark blue, rectangular shape with rounded corners that contains the text "WEEK 5" in large, white, sans-serif font. Below this, centered as well, is "SESSION 3," also in large, white, sans-serif font.
*   **Background Design:** The dark blue rectangle sits on top of a lighter background that's filled with various stylized, flat-design icons and graphics. It appears to be a geometric or abstract design.
*   **Header Graphic:** Above the words "WEEK 5" is a horizontal band with additional flat-design icons. These icons include a compass rose, arrows, a pencil, a small computer screen, a circuit board design, a graph/bar chart, and pencils.
*   **Bottom Graphic:** Below "SESSION 3" is another horizontal band of graphics. These seem to be similar to the top row.
*   **Overall Color Scheme:** The design uses a palette with different shades of blue, orange, yellow, and black.
*   **Framing:** The entire design is framed in a lighter, possibly orange-brown color. This frame gives the impression of a screen or presentation board.

Based on the text and visual elements, this image is likely a title or slide for a session. The "WEEK 5 SESSION 3" text indicates it could be part of a series of sessions or lessons. The stylized graphic elements suggest the subject matter may involve data analysis, charts, technology, or business.

Dont worry we have your correct scores. We have done spot checks to make sure of the data consistency. We are having some technical difficulties with getting the evaluations which are on the TDS server to the Portal Operations team. Kindly bear with us while we work out the problem.

(Its a data cleaning and packaging issue - a typical TDS problem

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overview:**
The image appears to be a table or a log displaying data, likely related to some sort of system or data tracking. It contains several rows of information, each with multiple columns.

**Column Breakdown:**

*   **Column 1:** "tds-2025-01-ga1" appears to be a unique identifier or label for each entry.
*   **Column 2:** "22f3000935@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" is an email address.
*   **Column 3:** A date and time stamp in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS".
*   **Column 4:** Numerical values (7.75 and 7) which may indicate a measure or variable
*   **Column 5:** Another column containing the number "10".

**Observations and Potential Interpretations:**

*   **Data Source:** The email address suggests a connection to an academic or research institution ("iitm.ac.in").
*   **Timestamps:** The timestamps indicate data was collected or recorded on January 26th and 27th of 2025.

because the previous score that you received was what you scored after the deadline. We had accidentally given students marks to students who submitted after the deadline. Here is the evidence.

**Image Description:** The image is a table showing quiz results.  It contains the following columns: "Quiz", "Email", "Time", "Total", and "Max".  There are two rows of data:

*   **Row 1:**
    *   Quiz: tds-2025-01-ga3
    *   Email: 21f3000745@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
    *   Time: 2025-02-06 18:53:58
    *   Total: 7
    *   Max: 9.5
*   **Row 2:**
    *   Quiz: tds-2025-01-ga3
    *   Email: 21f3000745@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
    *   Time: 2025-02-05 22:01:38
    *   Total: 6
    *   Max: 9.5

The table seems to be showing individual quiz scores, with the quiz ID, email of the participant, time of submission, their score ("Total"), and the maximum possible score ("Max").  Both rows show the same email and the same quiz name, suggesting two different quiz attempts by the same individual.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Structure:**

The image shows a section of a webpage or online learning platform, likely displaying assignment results. The page is organized into modules, and the details of one assignment within a module are presented.

**Module 1: Development Tools Section:**

*   **Header:** The section begins with a header "Module 1: Development Tools" in a dark blue font. There's an upward-pointing arrow, indicating this section is currently expanded.
*   **Assignment Details:**  Under the module header, there are the assignment details:
    *   **Assignment:** This is the label for this portion of the display.
    *   **Graded Assignment 1:** The specific assignment's name. It is likely a hyperlink.
    *   **Assessment (Due: 26 Jan 2025):**  Specifies the date the assignment was due.
    *   **Submitted:**  A label, possibly indicating the assignment has been successfully submitted. This text is in green.

**Score Breakdown (Table):**

The next section displays a table-like presentation of scores:

*   **Columns:** The table has three columns labeled:
    *   "Your Score"
    *   "Peer Average"
    *   "Median Score"
*   **Scores:**
    *   "Your Score": 100
    *   "Peer Average": 99%
    *   "Median Score": 100
*   **Chart Links:**  "View Chart" links are present below "Your Score" and "Peer Average", likely providing access to score distribution charts.

**Module 2: Deployment Tools Section:**

*   **Header:** The second module header is "Module 2: Deployment Tools", indicating a second section with related content.  A downward-pointing arrow indicates the section is currently collapsed.

**General Observations:**

*   The layout is clean and modern, with a focus on clarity.
*   The use of color is minimal, primarily used for emphasis.
*   This image depicts a learner's performance in an online course and assessment.
*   The user has a perfect score of 100.

![Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/8/1/81058cbc488778690f12f97fc46ec8f71a939028_2_690x247.png)

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a web page, likely a course dashboard or a learning management system (LMS). The design is clean and modern, with a dark color scheme and distinct course cards. There's a left-hand navigation panel, a top navigation bar, and several course cards displayed prominently in the center.

**Top Navigation Bar:**

*   **Logo:** At the top left, there's a logo for "IIT Madras Degree in Data Science and Applications."
*   **User Info:** The name "THAKUR VISHALKUMAR VINOD" is displayed on the top bar, likely indicating the logged-in user.  Next to it is a person icon and then an bell icon, which most likely represent notification features.
*   **Sign Out:**  A "SIGN OUT" button is located on the top right.

**Left-Hand Navigation Panel:**

There is a navigation panel on the left side of the screen, featuring various icons.  The panel seems to be collapsed, as only the icons are visible, and no text labels are displayed. It's highly likely these icons represent links to different sections within the course platform.

**Course Cards (Main Content):**

Four main course cards are prominently displayed, each containing the following elements:

*   **Course Title:** A clear title for each course is given (e.g., "Business Data Management," "Tools in Data Science," "Modern Application Development I," and "Machine Learning Techniques").
*   **Course Status:** Beneath the course title, each card shows whether it is a "NEW COURSE" or "IMPROVEMENT" in the case of the Modern Application Development I.
*   **Assignment Details:** Each card (excluding Business Data Management) includes assignment-specific information.  This includes "Week" number, and then "Assignment" name followed by scores for each week.
*   **"Go to Course page >" Button:** Each course card has a button labeled "Go to Course page >" to navigate to the course content.

**Course Card Details:**

*   **Business Data Management:** This card indicates "NEW COURSE".  There are no assignment scores listed.
*   **Tools in Data Science:**  Displays assignment scores for week 1 (Absent), week 2 (55.00), week 3 (100.00), and week 4 (100.00).
*   **Modern Application Development I:**  Displays assignment scores for week 1 (100.00), week 2 (72.00), week 3 (100.00), and week 4 (100.00).
*   **Machine Learning Techniques:** Displays assignment scores for week 1 (90.00), week 2 (100.00), week 3 (100.00), and week 4 (100.00).

**Color Scheme and Design:**

The website uses a dark color scheme, which is visually appealing. Course cards have a maroon background with a pattern in the back.

**Overall Impression:**

The image likely depicts a student dashboard within an IIT Madras course on Data Science and Applications, allowing users to access their enrolled courses and track their progress, and manage course-related details, such as assignment grades.

I have checked the backend server. The actual score is 85 in Module 1.


Ignore seek portal, because scores are evaluated externally on our server. Those scores on seek portal are just from the placeholder question that asked whether you saw GA1 and attempted it. It has no bearing on your actual marks.


The actual score will be in the dashboard soon.


Kind regards.

**Image Description:** The image shows a table with three rows and five columns of data. Each row likely represents a record, with the columns containing different pieces of information.

Here's a breakdown of the data:

*   **Column 1:** "tds-2025-01-ga3" (appears in all rows). This likely represents an identifier or category.
*   **Column 2:** "23f1002223@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" (appears in all rows). This appears to be an email address and the domain indicates a study program.
*   **Column 3:** Dates and times: "2025-02-06 01:13:34", "2025-02-06 00:22:25", "2025-02-05 23:59:07". These are timestamps, possibly indicating when an event or action occurred.
*   **Column 4:** Numerical values: "4.5", "4.5", "3.5".
*   **Column 5:** Numerical values: "9.5", "9.5", "9.5".

The table's structure suggests a dataset or log with three entries, each related to the same identifier ("tds-2025-01-ga3") and the same email address. The timestamps indicate the chronological order. The meaning of columns 4 and 5 cannot be determined without additional context.

Sorry for the late upload but as you can see in the screenshot i had submitted answers for TDS Week 2 graded assignment but it shows 0 both here and in current courses tab.

I did reload the recent tab before uploading and for tds ga submission i submit and keep the tab open until the timer runs out.

**Image Description:** Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Context:**

The image shows a webpage related to a graded assignment. The URL in the browser bar suggests it's hosted on a development server ("exam.sanand.workers.dev"). The content is likely related to a course or exam at IIT Madras (IITM). The title bar also refers to "TDS 2025 Jan GA2," likely indicating a course on data science or related field.

**Key Elements and Details:**

*   **Header/Status Bar:**
    *   A prominent red bar at the top states: "Ended at Sun, 2 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST Score: 0." This implies the assignment has ended and the current score is 0.  There are "Check all" and "Save" buttons nearby.
*   **User Information:**
    *   It displays "You are logged in as 22f1001901@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." This indicates the user's login credentials.
    *   A "Logout" button is present.
*   **Recent Saves Section:**
    *   A section titled "Recent saves" lists previous save times and scores. The most recent is from 2/3/2025, 12:00:30 AM, with a score of 8. Other save points are from 2/2/2025, both with a score of 8.
    *   Each save has a "Reload" button.
*   **Questions Section:**
    *   This section lists the questions for the assignment.
    *   The first question is "Write documentation in Markdown (1 mark)".
    *   The second question is "Compress an image (1 mark)".
*   **Browser Tabs/Title:**
    *   Multiple tabs are visible, including one for "Graded Assignment 2 = IITM Or", another for "TDS 2025 Jan GA2 - Deploymer", and another for "TDS 2025 Jan GAS - Data Prepa."

**Possible Questions and Inferences:**

*   The user might be trying to access an assignment they completed earlier, or they might be working on the assignment when the deadline has passed and the score is set to 0.
*   The user can reload the saved versions of the assignment.
*   The questions give information about the topics the assignment covers, such as markdown and image compression.
*   The website is likely for taking assignments in the IITM curriculum.

**Overall, the image depicts a webpage for an online graded assignment, likely within a data science or related course, at IIT Madras.**
